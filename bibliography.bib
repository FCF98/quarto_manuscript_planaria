	abstract = {Addiction is a disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and consumption observed in 20-30\% of users. An addicted individual will favor drug reward over natural rewards, despite major negative consequences. Mechanistic research on rodents modeling core components of the disease has identified altered synaptic transmission as the functional substrate of pathological behavior. While the initial version of a circuit model for addiction focused on early drug adaptive behaviors observed in all individuals, it fell short of accounting for the stochastic nature of the transition to compulsion. The model builds on the initial pharmacological effect common to all addictive drugs-an increase in dopamine levels in the mesolimbic system. Here, we consolidate this early model by integrating circuits underlying compulsion and negative reinforcement. We discuss the genetic and epigenetic correlates of individual vulnerability. Many recent data converge on a gain-of-function explanation for circuit remodeling, revealing blueprints for novel addiction therapies.},

	abstract = {Identifying vulnerable individuals before they transition to a compulsive pattern of drug seeking and taking is a key challenge in addiction to develop efficient prevention strategies. Oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been associated with compulsive-related disorders. To study compulsive cocaine-seeking behavior, a core component of drug addiction, we have used a rat model in which cocaine seeking despite a foot-shock contingency only emerges in some vulnerable individuals having escalated their cocaine intake. We show that abnormal oscillatory activity within the alpha/theta and low-beta bands during the escalation of cocaine intake phase predicts the subsequent emergence of compulsive-like seeking behavior. In fact, mimicking STN pathological activity in noncompulsive rats during cocaine escalation turns them into compulsive ones. We also find that 30 Hz, but not 130 Hz, STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) reduces pathological cocaine seeking in compulsive individuals. Our results identify an early electrical signature of future compulsive-like cocaine-seeking behavior and further advocates the use of frequency-dependent STN DBS for the treatment of addiction.},

Relapse to alcohol or tobacco seeking and consumption after abstinence is a major clinical challenge, and is often evoked by cue-induced craving. Therefore, disruption of the memory for the cue-drug association is expected to suppress relapse. Memories have been postulated to become labile shortly after their retrieval, during a "memory reconsolidation" process. Interference with the reconsolidation of drug-associated memories has been suggested as a possible strategy to reduce or even prevent cue-induced craving and relapse. Here, we surveyed the growing body of studies in animal models and in humans assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological or behavioral manipulations in reducing relapse by interfering with the reconsolidation of alcohol and nicotine/tobacco memories. Our review points to the potential of targeting the reconsolidation of these memories as a strategy to suppress relapse to alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking. However, we discuss several critical limitations and boundary conditions, which should be considered to improve the consistency and replicability in the field, and for development of an efficient reconsolidation-based relapse-prevention therapy.},

The past two decades of research have characterised the details of the molecular pathways supporting the reconsolidation of pavlovian cue-drug memories, with more recent work indicating that the reconsolidation of instrumental drug-seeking memories also relies upon similar mechanisms. This narrative review considers what is known about the mechanisms underlying the reconsolidation of pavlovian and instrumental memories associated with drug use, how these approaches have translated to experimental medicine studies, and the challenges and opportunities for the clinical use of reconsolidation-based therapies.},

We have investigated the functional significance of this circuitry in the control over a cocaine-seeking habit by using an intrastriatal disconnection procedure that combined a selective, unilateral lesion of the nucleus accumbens core and infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the contralateral dorsolateral striatum, thereby disrupting striato-midbrain-striatal serial connectivity bilaterally. We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction.},

The anatomical evidence for independent nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems has, however, long been obsolete. There is now compelling evidence that both nominal “systems” participate in reward function and addiction. Electrical stimulation of both SN and VTA is rewarding, blockade of glutamatergic or cholinergic input to either SN or VTA attenuates the habit-forming effects of intravenous cocaine, and dopamine in both nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic terminal fields participates in the defining property of rewarding events: the reinforcement of memory consolidation. Thus the similarities between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems may be as important as their differences.},

However, the brain circuitry that mediates the psychological process of "wanting" a particular reward is dissociable from circuitry that mediates the degree to which it is "liked." Incentive salience or "wanting," a form of motivation, is generated by large and robust neural systems that include mesolimbic dopamine. By comparison, "liking," or the actual pleasurable impact of reward consumption, is mediated by smaller and fragile neural systems, and is not dependent on dopamine. The incentive-sensitization theory posits the essence of drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological "wanting," especially triggered by cues, without necessarily an amplification of "liking." This is because of long-lasting changes in dopamine-related motivation systems of susceptible individuals, called "neural sensitization." A quarter-century after its proposal, evidence has continued to grow in support the incentive-sensitization theory. Further, its scope is now expanding to include diverse behavioral addictions and other psychopathologies.},

However, until recently, there has been almost no research on whether potentially addictive drugs produce forms of structural plasticity similar to those associated with other forms of experience-dependent plasticity. In this paper we summarize evidence that, indeed, exposure to amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine or morphine produces persistent changes in the structure of dendrites and dendritic spines on cells in brain regions involved in incentive motivation and reward (such as the nucleus accumbens), and judgment and the inhibitory control of behavior (such as the prefrontal cortex). It is suggested that structural plasticity associated with exposure to drugs of abuse reflects a reorganization of patterns of synaptic connectivity in these neural systems, a reorganization that alters their operation, thus contributing to some of the persistent sequela associated with drug use—including addiction.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments in the neurocircuitry and neurobiology of addiction from a perspective of allostasis. A model is proposed for brain changes that occur during the development of addiction that explain the persistent vulnerability to relapse long after drug-taking has ceased. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in the compulsive use and loss of control over drug-taking. The development of addiction recruits different sources of reinforcement, different neuroadaptive mechanisms, and different neurochemical changes to dysregulate the brain reward system. Counteradaptive processes such as opponent-process that are part of normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to form an allostatic state. Allostasis from the addiction perspective is defined as the process of maintaining apparent reward function stability by changes in brain reward mechanisms. The allostatic state represents a chronic deviation of reward set point and is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se, but also by the activation of brain and hormonal stress responses. The manifestation of this allostatic state as compulsive drug-taking and loss of control over drug-taking is hypothesized to be expressed through activation of brain circuits involved in compulsive behavior such as the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.},

Pharmacologically, cocaine shares major properties with at least 2 classes of pharmaceuticals. It is a local anesthetic and also a potent psychomotor stimulant. The psychomotor stimulant properties of cocaine are thought to be related to its ability to modify the metabolism and the activity of many neurotransmitter systems, such as acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). We and others have shown that all these neurotransmitters are potent stimulants of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion. The present study was undertaken to examine whether cocaine stimulates hypothalamic CRH secretion and whether or not such an effect is mediated by any of the above neurotransmitters. To accomplish this task, we employed a rat hypothalamic organ culture system, in which CRH secretion form single explanted hypothalami was evaluated by specific radioimmunoassay (iCRH). Cocaine stimulated iCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion with peak of activity at 10−8 M. Isolated or simultaneous pharmacologic blockade of cholinergic (atropine plus hexamethonium), serotonergic (ritanserin), α-adrenergic (phentolamine) and/or dopaminergic (compound SCH 23390) receptor subtypes failed to inhibit cocaine-induced iCRH secretion. On the other hand, cocaine-induced iCRH secretion was inhibited by GABA, a potent inhibitor of CRH secretion, dexamethasone, verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker, and carbamazepine, an antiepileptic and antidepressive agent. These data suggest that cocaine stimulates hypothalamic CRH secretion and that this effect may be related to the local anesthetic properties of cocaine rather than to increases of ACh, 5-HT, NE and/or DA. We speculate that cocaine activates the HPA axis in vivo by releasing hypothalamic CRH.},

	abstract = {Drug dependence is a chronically relapsing disorder that places an enormous strain on healthcare systems. For treatments to have long-term clinical value, they must address the causes of relapse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide central to the stress response, may be one key to solving the relapse cycle. CRF is hypothesized to mediate the elevated anxiety and negative emotional states experienced during the development of dependence. This review summarizes existing data on changes in the CRF system produced by drugs of abuse and the function of CRF receptors in regulating behavioural responses to drugs of abuse, with an emphasis on drug dependence. Drug-induced changes in neuronal excitability throughout the limbic system, as well as the reversal of these neuroadaptations by CRF receptor antagonists, are also addressed. CRF receptor antagonists, by reducing the motivational effects of drug withdrawal and protracted abstinence, are proposed to be novel therapeutic targets for drug abuse and addiction.},

	abstract = {Many of the withdrawal symptoms reported by human cocaine users are thought to be correlated with serotonergic dysfunction. To explore the neurochemical basis for this hypothesis, we used in vivo microdialysis to monitor extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of the rat both during and for several hours after unlimited-access intravenous cocaine self-administration. Self-administration of cocaine produced an increase of approx. 340\% of baseline in the dialysate concentration of 5-HT that persisted for the entire 12 h session. During the first 6 h after self-administration, dialysate 5-HT levels were significantly decreased to 41\% of pre-session levels and 25\% of the levels in drug-naive control animals. The effects of cocaine exposure on basal extracellular 5-HT concentrations were also examined using a quantitative microdialysis method (Difference Method). Rats withdrawing from extended-access cocaine self-administration displayed significantly lower extracellular 5-HT levels (0.6 +/- 0.3 nM) than either drug-naive control animals (2.0 +/- 0.5 nM) or animals which received daily 3-h self-administration training sessions only (limited-access; 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM). Together these results indicate that extracellular 5-HT is significantly decreased in the nucleus accumbens during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration. The severity of this decrease is contingent on the length of time cocaine is self-administered.},

Maximal inhibition of DA release ( (mean ± S.E.M. 66.15 ± 3.30 percent of basal levels) was observed between 4–6 h after cessation of cocaine intake and was postively correlated (r = 0.88) with the duration of the preceding self-administration episode.

Allostasis, or stability through change, has most often been linked with challenges to homeostasis, in which repeated challenges or stressors produce sufficient allostatic load to generate an allostatic state that can ultimately lead to a disease state. The present review argues that the impact of stress on drug addiction fits with an allostatic model and represents a challenge to brain circuit regulatory mechanisms that underlie the emotional state of the animal. The central thesis is that stress leads to changes in corticotropin-releasing factor in the brain that impact addiction. Stress is further argued to impact all three stages of the addiction cycle—binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation—exposing the animal to an emotional allostatic load and allostatic state that forms the growing motivational pathology of addiction. Viewing addiction as an allostatic mechanism provides key insights into the ways in which dysregulated neurocircuitry that is involved in basic motivational systems can transition to pathophysiology.},

Major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine interact with DAT to mediate their effects by enhancing extracellular DA concentrations. We previously identified a novel allosteric site in the related human serotonin transporter that lies outside the central substrate and inhibitor binding pocket. We used the hybrid structure based (HSB) method to screen for allosteric modulator molecules that target a similar site in DAT. We identified a compound, KM822, that was found to be a selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of DAT. We confirmed the structural determinants of KM822 allosteric binding within the allosteric site by structure/function and substituted cysteine scanning accessibility biotinylation experiments. In the in vitro cell-based assay and ex vivo in both rat striatal synaptosomal and slice preparations, KM822 was found to decrease the affinity of cocaine for DAT. The in vivo effects of KM822 on cocaine were tested on psychostimulant-associated behaviors in a planarian model where KM822 specifically inhibited the locomotion elicited by DAT-interacting stimulants amphetamine and cocaine. Overall, KM822 provides a unique opportunity as a molecular probe to examine allosteric modulation of DAT function.},

While the first is commonly administered by insufflation ('snorting') or intravenously, the second is adapted for inhalation (smoking). Cocaine can exert local anaesthetic action by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thus halting electrical impulse propagation; cocaine also impacts neurotransmission by hindering monoamine reuptake, particularly dopamine, from the synaptic cleft. The excess of available dopamine for postsynaptic activation mediates the pleasurable effects reported by users and contributes to the addictive potential and toxic effects of the drug. Cocaine is metabolised (mostly hepatically) into two main metabolites, ecgonine methyl ester and benzoylecgonine. Other metabolites include, for example, norcocaine and cocaethylene, both displaying pharmacological action, and the last one constituting a biomarker for co-consumption of cocaine with alcohol.

	abstract = {Planaria represents the most primitive example of centralization and cephalization of nervous system. Previous reports indicate that planaria shows specific behavioral patterns, analogous to mammalian stereotypes, in response to drugs acting on acetylcholine or dopamine transmission. Here we further characterized these responses, and investigated the interactions between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems by means of behavioral methods. Exposure to cholinergic agonists physostigmine or nicotine produced hypokinesia with ‘bridge-like’ and ‘walnut’ positions, respectively. Blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine produced ‘screw-like’ hyperkinesia. Exposure to dopamine agonists (nomifensine, apomorphine) produced marked hyperkinesia with ‘screw-like’ movements. Finally, exposure to dopamine antagonists produced immobility or ‘bridge-like’ position. Pre-exposure to physostigmine blocked the behavioral effects of nomifensine and reduced and markedly delayed the behavioral effects of apomorphine. Pre-exposure to apomorphine slightly reduced and delayed the behavioral changes by physostigmine. Finally, planaria exposed to atropine after either SCH23388 or sulpiride showed ‘C-like’ or ‘screw-like’ hyperkinesia, respectively. Thus, reduction of cholinergic transmission seems to play a pivotal role in determining hyperkinesia in planaria. Under these conditions, different patterns of hyperkinetic activities occur, according to the subpopulation of dopamine receptors stimulated by drugs. These findings suggest that interactions between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems occur very early in animal phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Cocaine-induced cardiovascular emergencies are mediated by excessive adrenergic stimulation. Animal studies suggest that cocaine not only blocks norepinephrine reuptake peripherally but also inhibits the baroreceptors, thereby reflexively increasing sympathetic nerve discharge. However, the effect of cocaine on sympathetic nerve discharge in humans is unknown. In 12 healthy volunteers, we recorded blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharge to the skeletal muscle vasculature using intraneural microelectrodes (peroneal nerve) during intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg, n = 8) or lidocaine (2\%, n = 4), an internal local anesthetic control, or intravenous phenylephrine (0.5-2.0 microg/kg, n = 4), an internal sympathomimetic control. Experiments were repeated while minimizing the cocaine-induced rise in blood pressure with intravenous nitroprusside to negate sinoaortic baroreceptor stimulation. After lidocaine, blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharge were unchanged. After cocaine, blood pressure increased abruptly and remained elevated for 60 min while sympathetic nerve discharge initially was unchanged and then decreased progressively over 60 min to a nadir that was only 2+/-1\% of baseline (P {\textless} 0.05); however, plasma venous norepinephrine concentrations (n = 5) were unchanged up to 60 min after cocaine. Sympathetic nerve discharge fell more rapidly but to the same nadir when blood pressure was increased similarly with phenylephrine. When the cocaine-induced increase in blood pressure was minimized (nitroprusside), sympathetic nerve discharge did not decrease but rather increased by 2.9 times over baseline (P {\textless} 0.05). Baroreflex gain was comparable before and after cocaine. We conclude that in conscious humans the primary effect of intranasal cocaine is to increase sympathetic nerve discharge to the skeletal muscle bed. Furthermore, sinoaortic baroreflexes play a pivotal role in modulating the cocaine-induced sympathetic excitation. The interplay between these excitatory and inhibitory neural influences determines the net effect of cocaine on sympathetic discharge targeted to the human skeletal muscle circulation.},

Researchers are seeking to understand how cocaine's many longer term effects produce addiction's persistent cravings and risk of relapse. In the author's laboratory, work has focused on buildup of the genetic transcription factor DeltaFosB. Levels of DeltaFosB in the limbic system correlate with addiction-like behaviors in mice and may precipitate very long-lasting changes to nerve cell structure. Further pursuit of this and similar leads are first steps toward a complete understanding of the transition from cocaine abuse to addiction -- and, ultimately, more effective treatments for those who are addicted.},

	abstract = {Background
Stimulant drugs can cause persistent changes in the brain. Imaging studies show that these changes are most apparent in dopamine transporter (DAT) or receptor availability within the striatum.
Methods
This work focuses on influences of stimulant use on dopaminergic function assessed using nuclear-medicine imaging (PET/SPECT). Included are 39 studies on 655 cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine or nicotine users, as well as 690 healthy controls. Metaanalyses were conducted separately for D2/D3 receptors and dopamine transporters of the entire striatum, its subregions caudate and putamen respectively.
Results
Meta-analyses results regarding nicotine did not show significant effects between smokers and nonsmokers. In cocaine users there was a significant decrease in dopamine receptor availability in all regions. The striatal DAT availability was significantly increased in cocaine users. Methamphetamine users showed a significantly decreased dopamine receptor and transporter density in all regions. Significant results also indicate a lower transporter availability in all regions. Amphetamine users showed reduced DAT availability in the striatum, as well as in the sub regions.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis provides evidence that there are ongoing changes in the dopaminergic system associated with the use of stimulants. Especially the results of cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine use mainly showed a downregulation. In addition, this meta-analysis is the first to include nicotine. This subset of studies showed evidence for a decreased receptor and DAT availability but no significant results were found in the metaanalyses.},

	abstract = {Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is reduced in cigarette smokers and this may promote the reinforcing actions of nicotine, thereby enhancing the addictive properties of cigarettes. At present, it is unclear how cigarette smoking leads to MAO inhibition, but preclinical studies in rodents show that MAO inhibition increases nicotine self-administration, especially at low doses of nicotine. This effect of MAO inhibition develops slowly, likely due to plasticity of brain monoamine systems; studies relying on acute MAO inhibition are unlikely to replicate what happens with smoking. Given that MAO inhibition may reduce the threshold level at which nicotine becomes reinforcing, it is important to consider this in the context of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes and potential tobacco product regulation. It is also important to consider how this interaction between MAO inhibition and the reinforcing actions of nicotine may be modified in populations that are particularly vulnerable to nicotine dependence. In the context of these issues, we show that the MAO-inhibiting action of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is similar in VLNC cigarettes and cigarettes with a standard nicotine content. In addition, we present evidence that in a rodent model of schizophrenia the effect of MAO inhibition to enhance nicotine self-administration is absent, and speculate how this may relate to brain serotonin systems. These issues are relevant to the MAO-inhibiting effect of cigarette smoking and its implications to tobacco product regulation.},

Storage of the long-term memory for sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia has been extensively studied in this respect and is associated with the growth of new synapses by the sensory neurons onto their postsynaptic target neurons. Recent time-lapse imaging studies of living sensory-to-motor neuron synapses in culture have monitored both functional and structural changes simultaneously so as to follow remodeling and growth at the same specific synaptic connections continuously over time and to examine the functional contribution of these learning-related structural changes to the different time-dependent phases of memory storage. Insights provided by these studies suggest the synaptic differentiation and growth induced by learning in the mature nervous system are highly dynamic and often rapid processes that can recruit both molecules and mechanisms used for de novo synapse formation during development.},

	abstract = {Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis experience enormous changes in both morphology and lifestyle. The current study examines whether larval experience can persist through pupation into adulthood in Lepidoptera, and assesses two possible mechanisms that could underlie such behavior: exposure of emerging adults to chemicals from the larval environment, or associative learning transferred to adulthood via maintenance of intact synaptic connections. Fifth instar Manduca sexta caterpillars received an electrical shock associatively paired with a specific odor in order to create a conditioned odor aversion, and were assayed for learning in a Y choice apparatus as larvae and again as adult moths. We show that larvae learned to avoid the training odor, and that this aversion was still present in the adults. The adult aversion did not result from carryover of chemicals from the larval environment, as neither applying odorants to naïve pupae nor washing the pupae of trained caterpillars resulted in a change in behavior. In addition, we report that larvae trained at third instar still showed odor aversion after two molts, as fifth instars, but did not avoid the odor as adults, consistent with the idea that post-metamorphic recall involves regions of the brain that are not produced until later in larval development. The present study, the first to demonstrate conclusively that associative memory survives metamorphosis in Lepidoptera, provokes intriguing new questions about the organization and persistence of the central nervous system during metamorphosis. Our results have both ecological and evolutionary implications, as retention of memory through metamorphosis could influence host choice by polyphagous insects, shape habitat selection, and lead to eventual sympatric speciation.},

When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm DNA from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed CpG hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels.},

Experiments with Caenorhabditis elegans, which exhibits robust heritable epigenetic effects, demonstrated small RNAs as key factors of TEI. Here, we discuss three major barriers to TEI in animals, two of which, the ?Weismann barrier? and germline epigenetic reprogramming, have been known for decades. These are thought to effectively prevent TEI in mammals but not to the same extent in C. elegans. We argue that a third barrier?that we termed ?somatic epigenetic resetting??may further inhibit TEI and, unlike the other two, restricts TEI in C. elegans as well. While epigenetic information can overcome the Weismann barrier and transmit from the soma to the germline, it usually cannot ?travel back? directly from the germline to the soma in subsequent generations. Nevertheless, heritable germline memory may still influence the animal's physiology by indirectly modifying gene expression in somatic tissues.},

Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, which might be explained by the known circuit connections in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding. However, for both classical and operant conditioning, adenylyl cyclase is a molecular site of convergence of the two signals that are associated. Learning in other invertebrate preparations also involves many of the same mechanisms, which may contribute to learning in vertebrates as well.},

Although dysfunction of the dopaminergic valuation system of the brain is known to contribute towards unconstrained reward seeking2,3, the underlying reasons for this behaviour are unclear. Here we describe dopaminergic neural mechanisms that produce reward seeking despite adverse consequences in Drosophila melanogaster. Odours paired with optogenetic activation of a defined subset of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons become cues that starved flies seek while neglecting food and enduring electric shock punishment. Unconstrained seeking of reward is not observed after learning with sugar or synthetic engagement of other dopaminergic neuron populations. Antagonism between reward-encoding and punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons accounts for the perseverance of reward seeking despite punishment, whereas synthetic engagement of the reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons also impairs the ordinary need-dependent dopaminergic valuation of available food. Connectome analyses reveal that the population of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons receives highly heterogeneous input, consistent with parallel representation of diverse rewards, and recordings demonstrate state-specific gating and satiety-related signals. We propose that a similar dopaminergic valuation system dysfunction is likely to contribute to maladaptive seeking of rewards by mammals.},

	abstract = {It has been 70 years since Donald Hebb published his formalized theory of synaptic adaptation during learning. Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved.

In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation. We then outline areas requiring further investigation on how cellular changes contribute to systems consolidation. Finally, we highlight recent findings on the cellular architecture of memory traces in rodents and how the application of new technologies will expand our understanding of systems consolidation at the neural circuit level. In the coming years, this research focus will be critical for understanding the evolution of long-term memories and for enabling the development of novel therapeutics which embrace the dynamic nature of memories.
The molecular biology of synaptic consolidation is relatively well-defined. By contrast, the molecular mechanisms of systems consolidation remain poorly understood.
Recent technological developments have helped advance our understanding of the cellular representation of memories in the brain.
One of the goals of future research is to clarify how noncanonical forms of synaptic transmission (e.g., exosomally transported RNA, associated RNA-binding proteins, and epigenetic modifications to the transported RNA) may contribute to systems consolidation.
Integrating tools for examining these noncanonical cellular and molecular mechanisms with tools for tagging select circuits of a memory trace will be highly informative for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of systems consolidation.},

Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

On the basis of the survey of the literature, it shows that there are consistent correlations between global changes in epigenetic regulation and the capacity for learning. The chapter suggests that learning dynamics may be reflected by cumulative epigenetic changes at the neuron level. It discusses the implications of epigenetic mechanisms for the study of the inheritance and evolution of learning.

	abstract = {A defining characteristic of the brain is its remarkable capacity to undergo activity-dependent functional and morphological remodeling via mechanisms of plasticity that form the basis of our capacity to encode and retain memories. Today, it is generally accepted that the neurobiological substrate of memories resides in activity-driven modifications of synaptic strength and structural remodeling of neural networks activated during learning. Since the discovery of long-term potentiation, the role of synaptic strengthening in learning and memory has been the subject of considerable investigation, and numerous studies have provided new insights into how this form of plasticity can subserve memory function. At the same time, other studies have explored the contribution of synaptic elimination or weakening; synaptogenesis, the growth of new synaptic connections and synapse remodeling; and more recently, neurogenesis, the birth and growth of new neurons in the adult brain. In this review, based on work in the hippocampus, the authors briefly outline recent advances in their understanding of the mechanisms and functional role of these four types of brain plasticity in the context of learning and memory. While they have long been considered as alternative mechanisms of plasticity underlying the storage of long-term memories, recent evidence suggests that they are functionally linked, suggesting the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the brain required for the formation and retention of memories are multifaceted.

However, human language-dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.},

Immunofluorescence study showed direct evidence that acridine orange-stained EV DNAs could be transferred into the cells and localize to and inside the nuclear membrane. However, whether the transferred EV DNAs are functional or not is not clear. We found that EV gDNAs could be homologously or heterologously transferred from donor cells to recipient cells, and increase gDNA-coding mRNA, protein expression, and function (e.g. AT1 receptor). An endogenous promoter of the AT1 receptor, NF-κB, could be recruited to the transferred DNAs in the nucleus, and increase the transcription of AT1 receptor in the recipient cells. Moreover, the transferred EV gDNAs have pathophysiological significance. BCR/ABL hybrid gene, involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, could be transferred from K562 EVs to HEK293 cells or neutrophils. Our present study shows that the gDNAs transferred from EVs to cells have physiological significance, not only to increase the gDNA-coding mRNA and protein levels, but also to influence function in recipient cells.},

While the history of this field is filled with controversies, mechanisms for transmission of information across generations are being elucidated in different organisms. Most strikingly, it is now clear that in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, somatic responses can control gene activity in descendants via heritable small RNA molecules, and that this type of inheritance is tightly regulated by dedicated machinery. In this perspective we will focus mostly on studies conducted using C. elegans, and examine recent work on the connection between small RNAs in the nervous system and germline. We will discuss the evidence for the inheritance of brain-orchestrated behavior, and its possible significance.},

Using C2C12 myogenic stem-like cells, we show that stress memory elicited by transient, low-level arsenite exposure is stored within a self-renewing subpopulation of progeny cells in a mitochondrial-dependent fashion. Importantly, we demonstrate that erasure of mitoengrams by administration of mitochondria-targeted electron scavenger was sufficient to reset key epigenetic marks of cellular memory and redirect the identity of the mitoengram-harboring progeny cells to a non-stress-like state. Together, our findings indicate that mnemonic information emanating from mitochondria support the balance between the persistence and transience of cellular memory.

In addition, we find evidence that the LTM for sensitization persists covertly after its apparent elimination by the same antimnemonic treatments that erase learning-related synaptic growth.

Formation and elimination of synapses reflect structural plasticity of neuronal connectivity. Here we performed high-resolution two-photon imaging of dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex of four macaque monkeys and found that spines were in general highly stable, with low percentages undergoing synaptic turnover. By observing the same spines at weekly intervals, we found that newly formed spines were more susceptible to elimination, with only 40\% persisting over a period of months. Analyses of spatial distribution of large numbers of spines revealed that spine distribution was neither uniform nor random, favoring inter-spine distances of 2–4 μm. Furthermore, spine formation and elimination occurred more often in low- and high-density dendritic segments, respectively, and preferentially within a hot zone of ∼4 μm from existing spines. Our results demonstrate long-term stability and spatially regulated spine dynamics in the macaque cortex and provide a structural basis for understanding neural circuit plasticity in the primate brain.
Reported high resolution long-term observation of dendritic spines in macaque, demonstrated the spine dynamics of L5 dlPFC neurons in puberty and adult monkeys and the spatial rule of spine distribution.},

	abstract = {Abstract Hibernators display severe changes in brain structure during deep torpor, including alterations in synaptic constitution. To address a possible effect on long-term memory, we examined learning behavior and memory of the hibernator Marmota marmota . In two operant conditioning tasks, the marmots learned to jump on two boxes or to walk through a tube. The animals were trained during their active season. Performance improved during the training phase and remained stable in a last test, four weeks before entrance into hibernation. When retested after six months of hibernation, skills were found to be unimpaired (box: before hibernation: 258.2 ± 17.7 s, after hibernation: 275.0 ± 19.8 s; tube: before hibernation: 158.4 ± 9.0 s, after hibernation: 137.7 ± 6.3 s). Contrary to these findings, memory seemed to be less fixed during the active season, since changes in test procedure resulted in impaired test performance. Besides the operant conditioning, we investigated the animals' habituation to a novel environment by repeated open field exposure. In the first run, animals showed exploratory behavior and thus a high locomotor activity was observed (63.6 ± 10.7 crossed squares). Upon a second exposure, all animals immediately moved into one corner and locomotion ceased (7.2 ± 1.9 crossed squares). This habituation was not altered even after hibernation (6.1 ± 1.1 crossed squares). We thus conclude that long-term memory is unaffected by hibernation in Alpine marmots.},

	abstract = {The ability to form memories in the brain is needed for daily functions, and its impairment is associated with human mental disorders. Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM)-related processes such as its consolidation, extinction and forgetting involve changes of synaptic efficacy produced by alterations in neural transmission and morphology. Modulation of the morphology and number of dendritic spines has been proposed to contribute to changes in neuronal transmission mediating such LTM-related processes. Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation and it can affect spine morphology by controlling actin-regulatory proteins. Recent evidence shows that changes in Rac GTPase activity affect memory consolidation, extinction, erasure and forgetting and can affect spine morphology in brain areas that mediate these behaviors. Altered Rac GTPase activity is associated with abnormal spine morphology and brain disorders. By affecting Rac GTPase activity we can further understand the roles of spine morphogenesis in memory. Moreover, manipulation of Rac GTPase activity may serve as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of memory-related brain diseases.},

	abstract = {Memory is attributed to strengthened synaptic connections among particular brain neurons, yet synaptic membrane components are transient, whereas memories can endure. This suggests synaptic information is encoded and 'hard-wired' elsewhere, e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron. In long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular and molecular model for memory, post-synaptic calcium ion (Ca²⁺) flux activates the hexagonal Ca²⁺-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII), a dodacameric holoenzyme containing 2 hexagonal sets of 6 kinase domains. Each kinase domain can either phosphorylate substrate proteins, or not (i.e. encoding one bit). Thus each set of extended CaMKII kinases can potentially encode synaptic Ca²⁺ information via phosphorylation as ordered arrays of binary 'bits'. Candidate sites for CaMKII phosphorylation-encoded molecular memory include microtubules (MTs), cylindrical organelles whose surfaces represent a regular lattice with a pattern of hexagonal polymers of the protein tubulin. Using molecular mechanics modeling and electrostatic profiling, we find that spatial dimensions and geometry of the extended CaMKII kinase domains precisely match those of MT hexagonal lattices. This suggests sets of six CaMKII kinase domains phosphorylate hexagonal MT lattice neighborhoods collectively, e.g. conveying synaptic information as ordered arrays of six "bits", and thus "bytes", with 64 to 5,281 possible bit states per CaMKII-MT byte. Signaling and encoding in MTs and other cytoskeletal structures offer rapid, robust solid-state information processing which may reflect a general code for MT-based memory and information processing within neurons and other eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Complex behavior is associated with animals with nervous systems, but decision-making and learning also occur in non-neural organisms [1], including singly nucleated cells [2-5] and multi-nucleate synctia [6-8]. Ciliates are single-cell eukaryotes, widely dispersed in aquatic habitats [9], with an extensive behavioral repertoire [10-13]. In 1906, Herbert Spencer Jennings [14, 15] described in the sessile ciliate Stentor roeseli a hierarchy of responses to repeated stimulation, which are among the most complex behaviors reported for a singly nucleated cell [16, 17]. These results attracted widespread interest [18, 19] and exert continuing fascination [7, 20-22] but were discredited during the behaviorist orthodoxy by claims of non-reproducibility [23]. These claims were based on experiments with the motile ciliate Stentor coeruleus. We acquired and maintained the correct organism in laboratory culture and used micromanipulation and video microscopy to confirm Jennings' observations. Despite significant individual variation, not addressed by Jennings, S. roeseli exhibits avoidance behaviors in a characteristic hierarchy of bending, ciliary alteration, contractions, and detachment, which is distinct from habituation or conditioning. Remarkably, the choice of contraction versus detachment is consistent with a fair coin toss. Such behavioral complexity may have had an evolutionary advantage in protist ecosystems, and the ciliate cortex may have provided mechanisms for implementing such behavior prior to the emergence of multicellularity. Our work resurrects Jennings' pioneering insights and adds to the list of exceptional features, including regeneration [24], genome rearrangement [25], codon reassignment [26], and cortical inheritance [27], for which the ciliate clade is renowned.

This article focuses on selected recent advances in consolidation research, including the reconsolidation of long-term memory items, the brain mechanisms of transformation of the content and of cue-dependency of memory items over time, as well as the role of rest and sleep in consolidating and shaping memories. Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end.},

Here we combined a local superfusion technique2,3 with two-photon imaging4, which allowed us to scrutinize specific regions of the postsynaptic dendrite where we knew that the synaptic changes had to occur. We show that after induction of long-lasting (but not short-lasting) functional enhancement of synapses in area CA1, new spines appear on the postsynaptic dendrite, whereas in control regions on the same dendrite or in slices where long-term potentiation was blocked, no significant spine growth occurred.},

The usual assumption is that information is transmitted by firing rates. However, rate codes are energetically inefficient and computationally awkward. A combinatorial code is more plausible. If the engram consists of altered synaptic conductances (the usual assumption), then we must ask how numbers may be written to synapses. It is much easier to formulate a coding hypothesis if the engram is realized by a cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism.},

The most widely accepted hypothesis at present is that long-term memory is stored as stable, learning-induced changes in synaptic connections. This hypothesis, the synaptic plasticity hypothesis of memory, is supported by extensive experimental data gathered from over 50 years of research. Nonetheless, there are important mnemonic phenomena that the synaptic plasticity hypothesis cannot, or cannot readily, account for. Furthermore, recent work indicates that epigenetic and genomic mechanisms play heretofore underappreciated roles in memory. Here, we critically assess the evidence that supports the synaptic plasticity hypothesis and discuss alternative non-synaptic, nuclear mechanisms of memory storage, including DNA methylation and retrotransposition. We argue that long-term encoding of memory is mediated by nuclear processes; synaptic plasticity, by contrast, represents a means of relatively temporary memory storage. In addition, we propose that memories are evaluated for their mnemonic significance during an initial period of synaptic storage; if assessed as sufficiently important, the memories then undergo nuclear encoding.

I propose that memory is stored in the brain in a mechanically encoded binary format written into the conformations of proteins found in the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions that organise each and every synapse. The MeshCODE framework outlined here represents a unifying theory of data storage in animals, providing read-write storage of both dynamic and persistent information in a binary format. Mechanosensitive proteins that contain force-dependent switches can store information persistently, which can be written or updated using small changes in mechanical force. These mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, scaffold each synapse, creating a meshwork of switches that together form a code, the so-called MeshCODE. Large signalling complexes assemble on these scaffolds as a function of the switch patterns and these complexes would both stabilise the patterns and coordinate synaptic regulators to dynamically tune synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains would operate the cytoskeletal machinery to write and update the synaptic MeshCODEs, thereby propagating this coding throughout the organism. Based on established biophysical principles, such a mechanical basis for memory would provide a physical location for data storage in the brain, with the binary patterns, encoded in the information-storing mechanosensitive molecules in the synaptic scaffolds, and the complexes that form on them, representing the physical location of engrams. Furthermore, the conversion and storage of sensory and temporal inputs into a binary format would constitute an addressable read-write memory system, supporting the view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.},

	abstract = {Dendritic spines, the carriers of long-term memory, occupy a small fraction of cortical space, and yet they are the major consumers of brain metabolic energy. What fraction of this energy goes for synaptic plasticity, correlated with learning and memory? It is estimated here based on neurophysiological and proteomic data for rat brain that, depending on the level of protein phosphorylation, the energy cost of synaptic plasticity constitutes a small fraction of the energy used for fast excitatory synaptic transmission, typically 4.0?11.2\%. Next, this study analyzes a metabolic cost of new learning and its memory trace in relation to the cost of prior memories, using a class of cascade models of synaptic plasticity. It is argued that these models must contain bidirectional cyclic motifs, related to protein phosphorylation, to be compatible with basic thermodynamic principles. For most investigated parameters longer memories generally require proportionally more energy to store. The exceptions are the parameters controlling the speed of molecular transitions (e.g., ATP-driven phosphorylation rate), for which memory lifetime per invested energy can increase progressively for longer memories. Furthermore, in general, a memory trace decouples dynamically from a corresponding synaptic metabolic rate such that the energy expended on new learning and its memory trace constitutes in most cases only a small fraction of the baseline energy associated with prior memories. Taken together, these empirical and theoretical results suggest a metabolic efficiency of synaptically stored information.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Learning and memory involve a sequence of molecular events in dendritic spines called synaptic plasticity. These events are physical in nature and require energy, which has to be supplied by ATP molecules. However, our knowledge of the energetics of these processes is very poor. This study estimates the empirical energy cost of synaptic plasticity and considers theoretically a metabolic rate of learning and its memory trace in a class of cascade models of synaptic plasticity.},

Among these intercellular specialized structures, tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are now recognized as a means of cell-to-cell communication through the exchange of cellular cargo, controlled by a variety of biological triggers, as described here. Intercellular communication is fundamental to brain function. It allows the dialogue between the many cells, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, microglia, necessary for the proper development and function of the brain.

Karl Lashley began the search for the engram nearly seventy years ago. In the time since, much has been learned but divisions remain. In the contemporary neurobiology of learning and memory, two profoundly different conceptions contend: the associative/connectionist (A/C) conception and the computational/representational (C/R) conception. Both theories ground themselves in the belief that the mind is emergent from the properties and processes of a material brain. Where these theories differ is in their description of what the neurobiological substrate of memory is and where it resides in the brain. The A/C theory of memory emphasizes the need to distinguish memory cognition from the memory engram and postulates that memory cognition is an emergent property of patterned neural activity routed through engram circuits. In this model, learning re-organizes synapse association strengths to guide future neural activity. Importantly, the version of the A/C theory advocated for here contends that synaptic change is not symbolic and, despite normally being necessary, is not sufficient for memory cognition. Instead, synaptic change provides the capacity and a blueprint for reinstating symbolic patterns of neural activity. Unlike the A/C theory, which posits that memory emerges at the circuit level, the C/R conception suggests that memory manifests at the level of intracellular molecular structures. In C/R theory, these intracellular structures are information-conveying and have properties compatible with the view that brain computation utilizes a read/write memory, functionally similar to that in a computer. New research has energized both sides and highlighted the need for new discussion. Both theories, the key questions each theory has yet to resolve and several potential paths forward are presented here.},

Using examples from developmental biology, evolution, and synthetic bioengineering, in addition to neuroscience, I propose that a perspective on memory as preserving salience, not fidelity, is applicable to many phenomena on scales from cells to societies. Continuous commitment to creative, adaptive confabulation, from the molecular to the behavioral levels, is the answer to the persistence paradox as it applies to individuals and whole lineages. I also speculate that a substrate-independent, processual view of life and mind suggests that memories, as patterns in the excitable medium of cognitive systems, could be seen as active agents in the sense-making process. I explore a view of life as a diverse set of embodied perspectives—nested agents who interpret each other’s and their own past messages and actions as best as they can (polycomputation). This synthesis suggests unifying symmetries across scales and disciplines, which is of relevance to research programs in Diverse Intelligence and the engineering of novel embodied minds.},

Substantial evidence suggests that memory involves learning-dependent changes at synapses, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, understanding the storages process that underlies LTP may provide insight into how the engram is stored. LTP involves induction, maintenance (storage), and expression sub-processes; special tests are required to specifically reveal properties of the storage process. The strongest of these is the Erasure test in which a transiently applied agent that attacks a putative storage molecule may lead to persistent erasure of previously induced LTP/memory. Two major hypotheses have been proposed for LTP/memory storage: the CaMKII and PKM-zeta hypotheses. After discussing the tests that can be used to identify the engram (Necessity test, Saturation/Occlusion test, Erasure test), the status of these hypotheses is evaluated, based on the literature on LTP and memory-guided behavior. Review of the literature indicates that all three tests noted above support the CaMKII hypothesis when done at both the LTP level and at the behavioral level. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the engram is stored by an LTP process in which CaMKII is a critical memory storage molecule.},

Specifically, understanding how organisms on the lower branches of the phylogenetic tree become familiar with, value and exploit elements of an ecological niche while avoiding harm can be expected to aid understanding of how organisms that evolved later (including
) do the same or similar things. We call this approach basal cognition. In this introductory essay, we explain what the approach involves. Because no definition of cognition exists that reflects its biological basis, we advance a working definition that can be operationalized; introduce a behaviour-generating toolkit of capacities that comprise the function (e.g. sensing/perception, memory, valence, learning, decision making, communication), each element of which can be studied relatively independently; and identify a (necessarily incomplete) suite of common biophysical mechanisms found throughout the domains of life involved in implementing the toolkit. The articles in this collection illuminate different aspects of basal cognition across different forms of biological organization, from prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes-the focus of Part 1-to plants and finally to animals, without and with nervous systems, the focus of Part 2. By showcasing work in diverse, currently disconnected fields, we hope to sketch the outline of a new multidisciplinary approach for comprehending cognition, arguably the most fascinating and hard-to-fathom evolved function on this planet. Doing so has the potential to shed light on problems in a wide variety of research domains, including microbiology, immunology, zoology, biophysics, botany, developmental biology, neurobiology/science, regenerative medicine, computational biology, artificial life and synthetic bioengineering.

Our findings reveal that memory encoding leads to an epigenetic priming event, marked by increased accessibility of enhancers without the corresponding transcriptional changes. Memory consolidation subsequently results in spatial reorganization of large chromatin segments and promoter-enhancer interactions. Finally, with reactivation, engram neurons use a subset of de novo long-range interactions, where primed enhancers are brought in contact with their respective promoters to upregulate genes involved in local protein translation in synaptic compartments.

	abstract = {Effects of hibernation on memory were tested in European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus). The animals were trained in summer to successfully accomplish two tasks: a spatial memory task in a maze and an operant task on a feeding machine. One group hibernated normally, and the other was prevented from hibernation by maintaining ambient temperature at 22 degrees C. In spring, the same tasks were repeated for both groups and their individual performances compared to the initial training phase. The experimental groups differed significantly in both tasks. The nonhibernating animals had higher levels of retention and needed significantly fewer trials to relearn the tasks than the group that had hibernated. In addition to testing the retention of conditioned tasks, social memory was also studied. The ground squirrels were given a social recognition test in spring with one familiar and one unfamiliar conspecific. In contrast to the conditioned tasks, social memory did not seem to be affected by hibernation. The results indicate negative effects of hibernation on the retention of conditioned tasks, which could produce important constraints on animals. A potential explanation for this memory loss might be changes in neuronal activity, which occur during hibernation.},

According to the synaptic trace theory of memory, activity-induced changes in the pattern of synaptic connections underlie the storage of information for long periods. In this framework, the stability of memory critically depends on the stability of the underlying synaptic connections. Surprisingly however, synaptic connections in the living brain are highly volatile, which poses a fundamental challenge to the synaptic trace theory. Here we review recent experimental evidence that link the initial formation of a memory with changes in the pattern of connectivity, but also evidence that synaptic connections are considerably volatile even in the absence of learning. Then we consider different theoretical models that have been put forward to explain how memory can be maintained with such volatile building blocks.},

C. elegans protects itself from pathogens by “reading” bacterial small RNAs, using this information to both induce avoidance and transmit memories for four generations. Here, we found that memories can be transferred from either lysed animals or from conditioned media to naive animals via Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. Moreover, Cer1 functions internally at the step of transmission of information from the germline to neurons and is required for learned avoidance. The presence of the Cer1 retrotransposon in wild C. elegans strains correlates with the ability to learn and inherit small-RNA-induced pathogen avoidance. Together, these results suggest that C. elegans has co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to instead protect itself and its progeny from a common pathogen through its inter-tissue signaling ability, hijacking this genomic element for its own adaptive immunity benefit.

cis
-regulatory influence of activated transposable elements on gene expression, as well as insertions into new genomic loci near the genes involved in brain functioning. RNAs and proteins of endogenous retroviruses are transported to dendritic synapses and transmit information to change gene expression in neighboring cells through the formation of virus-like particles in vesicles. Because of this, the relationship between synaptic plasticity and nuclear coding is ensured, since transposable elements are also drivers of epigenetic regulation owing to the relationship to the noncoding RNAs derived from them. Our analysis of the scientific literature allowed us to identify the role of 17 microRNAs derived from transposable elements in normal memory formation. In neurodegenerative diseases with memory impairment, we identified impaired expression of 44 microRNAs derived from transposable elements. This demonstrates the potential for targeting pathological transposon activation in neurodegenerative diseases for memory restoration using microRNAs as tools.},

First, excessive dopamine signaling during drug use may modulate gene expression, altering synaptic function and circuit activity and leading over time to maladaptive behaviors in vulnerable individuals. Second, on a longer timescale, life experience can shape the epigenetic landscape in brain and thereby may contribute to an individual’s vulnerability by amplifying drug-induced changes in gene expression that drive the transition to addiction. We conclude by exploring how epigenetic mechanisms might serve as therapeutic targets for addiction treatments.

	abstract = {Memories of past experiences guide future behaviour. Sparse ensembles of neurons, known as engrams, are thought to store memories in the brain. Neurons involved in a particular engram (“engram neurons”) are necessary for subsequent memory expression as memory retrieval is thought to be initiated by an external sensory cue reactivating engram neurons. However, conditions or environments are dynamic, such that future behaviour should be flexible. The role of engrams in mediating flexible behaviour is not understood. Here we examined this question using one type of flexible behaviour, extinction of a threat response. An initially neutral tone is first paired with an aversive footshock such that the tone alone induces defensive freezing. After subsequent repeated tone presentations without the footshock, rodents no longer freeze to the tone. Because the tone cue is thought to reactivate the engram to induce memory retrieval, we examined whether it is possible to induce an extinction-like behavioural effect by optogenetically reactivating the lateral amygdala component of the engram alone (without tone re-exposure). Similar to tone-induced extinction, mice showed decreased freezing to optogenetic stimulation of the lateral amygdala engram in the “extinction training” session. Moreover, “opto-extinguished” mice showed decreased freezing to the tone when subsequently tested for retrieval of the extinction training in the same context, suggesting that the opto-extinction transferred to the actual sensory stimulus. However, unlike tone extinction, in which mice showed renewal of tone-induced freezing when tested in a novel context, opto-extinguished mice continued to show a deficit in tone-induced freezing. Extinction has been characterized as new learning that inhibits the original memory or a phenomenon in which the original memory is "unlearned". Our findings suggest that opto-extinction may silence the original engram to “unlearn” the original memory.},

In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, parental responses can transmit heritable small RNAs that regulate gene expression transgenerationally. In this study, we show that a neuronal process can impact the next generations. Neurons-specific synthesis of RDE-4-dependent small RNAs regulates germline amplified endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and germline gene expression for multiple generations. Further, the production of small RNAs in neurons controls the chemotaxis behavior of the progeny for at least three generations via the germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Among the targets of these small RNAs, we identified the conserved gene saeg-2, which is transgenerationally downregulated in the germline. Silencing of saeg-2 following neuronal small RNA biogenesis is required for chemotaxis under stress. Thus, we propose a small-RNA-based mechanism for communication of neuronal processes transgenerationally.

It outlines the basic principles of the concept and then moves on to discuss functional as well as mechanistic aspects. The former relates to behavioral and cognitive studies, showing that weakly encoded memories, which ordinarily decay rapidly and are, therefore, forgotten, may be retained for much longer if they occur around the time of strongly encoded memories associated with novelty or surprise. The mechanistic section outlines work seeking to identify the molecular basis of this apparently synergistic effect on memory, specifically the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and the nature of plasticity-related proteins. It ends with a discussion of some outstanding questions, with many themes taken up in greater detail in other chapters of the book.},

	abstract = {Turnover—constant component production and destruction—is ubiquitous in biology. Turnover occurs across organisms and scales, including for RNAs, proteins, membranes, macromolecular structures, organelles, cells, hair, feathers, nails, antlers, and teeth. For many systems, turnover might seem wasteful when degraded components are often fully functional. Some components turn over with shockingly high rates and others do not turn over at all, further making this process enigmatic. However, turnover can address fundamental problems by yielding powerful properties, including regeneration, rapid repair onset, clearance of unpredictable damage and errors, maintenance of low constitutive levels of disrepair, prevention of stable hazards, and transitions. I argue that trade-offs between turnover benefits and metabolic costs, combined with constraints on turnover, determine its presence and rates across distinct contexts. I suggest that the limits of turnover help explain aging and that turnover properties and the basis for its levels underlie this fundamental component of life.
Biological systems are constantly building and destroying components. Whereas this turnover might at first seem needlessly wasteful, because degraded components are often fully functional, this Perspective describes a framework for conceptualizing how turnover at multiple scales can address fundamental challenges to maintain systems and for the basis for turnover levels.},

Chromatin regulation has been shown to generate short-term and long-term molecular memory within an individual cell. They have also been shown to underlie cell fate decisions (or cellular memory). Now, there is accumulating evidence that in the CNS, these same mechanisms may be pivotal for drug-induced changes in gene expression and ultimately long-term behavioral changes. As these mechanisms are also being found to be fundamental for learning and memory, an exciting new possibility is the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by manipulation of epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we critically discuss the evidence demonstrating a key role for chromatin regulation via histone acetylation in cocaine action.},

The finding that spine density decreases between young and adult ages in fixed tissues suggested that spines are dynamic. It is only a decade ago that two-photon microscopy (TPM) has unambiguously proven the dynamic nature of spines, through the repeated imaging of single spines in live animals. Spine dynamics comprise formation, disappearance, and stabilization of spines and are modulated by neuronal activity and developmental age. Here, we review several emerging concepts in the field that start to answer the following key questions: What are the external signals triggering spine dynamics and the molecular mechanisms involved?

Although these properties are lacking in engram cells under protein synthesis inhibitor-induced amnesia, direct optogenetic activation of these cells results in memory retrieval, and this correlates with retained engram cell-specific connectivity.

Despite being a cornerstone of brain function, questions surrounding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how information is encoded, stored, and recalled remain largely unanswered. One widely held theory is that an engram is formed by a group of neurons that are active during learning, which undergoes biochemical and physical changes to store information in a stable state, and that are later reactivated during recall of the memory. In the past decade, the development of engram labeling methodologies has proven useful to investigate the biology of memory at the molecular and cellular levels. Engram technology allows the study of individual memories associated with particular experiences and their evolution over time, with enough experimental resolution to discriminate between different memory processes: learning (encoding), consolidation (the passage from short-term to long-term memories), and storage (the maintenance of memory in the brain).

To assess the prevalence and identity of transferred proteins and the cellular specificity of transfer, we biotinylated retinal ganglion cell proteins in vivo and examined biotinylated proteins transported through the rodent visual circuit using microscopy, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy demonstrated preferential transfer of biotinylated proteins from retinogeniculate inputs to excitatory lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons compared with GABAergic neurons. An unbiased mass spectrometry-based screen identified ∼200 transneuronally transported proteins (TNTPs) isolated from the visual cortex. The majority of TNTPs are present in neuronal exosomes, and virally expressed TNTPs, including tau and β-synuclein, were detected in isolated exosomes and postsynaptic neurons. Our data demonstrate transfer of diverse endogenous proteins between neurons in the healthy intact brain and suggest that TNTP transport may be mediated by exosomes.

However, microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; endo-siRNAs, piRNAs, BC1, BC200, antisense and long ncRNAs, repeat-related transcripts, etc.) regulate mRNAs via effects on protein translation as well as transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Not only are genes ON or OFF, but their ability to be translated can be turned ON or OFF at the level of synapses, supporting an enormous increase in information capacity. Here, I review evidence that ncRNAs are expressed pervasively within dendrites in mammalian brain; that some are activity-dependent and highly enriched near synapses; and that synaptic ncRNAs participate in plasticity responses including learning and memory. Ultimately, ncRNAs can be viewed as the post-it notes of the neuron. They have no literal meaning of their own, but derive their functions from where (and to what) they are stuck. This may explain, in part, why ncRNAs differ so dramatically from protein-coding genes, both in terms of the usual indicators of functionality and in terms of evolutionary constraints. ncRNAs do not appear to be direct mediators of synaptic transmission in the manner of neurotransmitters or receptors, yet they orchestrate synaptic plasticity—and may drive species-specific changes in cognition.},

	abstract = {Stimuli that stimulate neurons elicit transcription of immediate-early genes, a process which requires local sites of chromosomal DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by topoisomerase IIb within a few minutes, followed by repair within a few hours. Wakefulness, exploring a novel environment, and contextual fear conditioning also elicit turn-on of synaptic genes requiring DSBs and repair. It has been reported (in non-neuronal cells) that extrachromosomal circular DNA can form at DSBs as the sites are repaired. I propose that activated neurons may generate extrachromosomal circular DNAs during repair at DSB sites, thus creating long-lasting "markers" of that activity pattern which contain sequences from their sites of origin and which regulate long-term gene expression. Although the population of extrachromosomal DNAs is diverse and overall associated with pathology, a subclass of small circular DNAs ("microDNAs," ∼100-400 bases long), largely derives from unique genomic sequences and has attractive features to act as stable, mobile circular DNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Circular DNAs can be templates for the transcription of RNAs, particularly small inhibitory siRNAs, circular RNAs and other non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNAs. These may regulate translation and transcription of other genes involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Another possible fate for mobile DNAs is to be inserted stably into chromosomes after new DSB sites are generated in response to subsequent activation events. Thus, the insertions of mobile DNAs into activity-induced genes may tend to inactivate them and aid in homeostatic regulation to avoid over-excitation, as well as providing a "counter" for a neuron's activation history. Moreover, activated neurons release secretory exosomes that can be transferred to recipient cells to regulate their gene expression. Mobile DNAs may be packaged into exosomes, released in an activity-dependent manner, and transferred to recipient cells, where they may be templates for regulatory RNAs and possibly incorporated into chromosomes. Finally, aging and neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) are also associated with an increase in DSBs in neurons. It will become important in the future to assess how pathology-associated DSBs may relate to activity-induced mobile DNAs, and whether the latter may potentially contribute to pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon described as interanimal transfer of learned responses from trained donor animals to untrained recipient animals by means of brain extracts has been regarded as problematic by many investigators and has generated extensive literature. Among major issues have been the reproducibility of the phenomenon and the viability of a learning interpretation of the recipients' behavior. The learning interpretation, if correct, makes direct experimental approaches to brain-behavior relationships feasible in the context of learning and memory. The review led to a number of conclusions with respect to the issues and evidence. Reproducibility has become less of a problem but has not been eliminated. Several species have been used successfully, and the effect has been reported over a wide range of tasks. The transfer effect, considered at a behavioral level of analysis, exhibits an empirical relationship with donor training and learning. While there is also evidence of a transfer of a nonspecific arousal factor, it cannot account for all of the data. Given the relatively crude extracts used in many cases, a 2-factor explanation of transfer appears most likely, in which an arousal transfer occurs under one set of conditions, and a learning transfer under others. The behavioral challenge resulting from this notion is the clear separation of the 2 effects. Biological and chemical mechanisms of the effect have not been widely researched, possibly due to a lack of formal consensus about what the transfer effect represents and thus its significance.

From the perspective of what we might call "classical cognitive science" it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists' doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists' objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented.

	abstract = {Cellular membrane potential plays a key role in the formation and retrieval of memories in the metazoan brain, but it remains unclear whether such memory can also be encoded in simpler organisms like bacteria. Here, we show that single-cell-level memory patterns can be imprinted in bacterial biofilms by light-induced changes in the membrane potential. We demonstrate that transient optical perturbations generate a persistent and robust potassium-channel-mediated change in the membrane potential of bacteria within the biofilm. The light-exposed cells respond in an anti-phase manner, relative to unexposed cells, to both natural and induced oscillations in extracellular ion concentrations. This anti-phase response, which persists for hours following the transient optical stimulus, enables a direct single-cell resolution visualization of spatial memory patterns within the biofilm. The ability to encode robust and persistent membrane-potential-based memory patterns could enable computations within prokaryotic communities and suggests a parallel between neurons and bacteria.

•Bacteria form membrane-potential-based memory, reminiscent of neurons•Bacterial memory is formed through a light-induced change to potassium channels•As predicted by a Hodgkin-Huxley model, memory is robust to ionic perturbations•Complex memory patterns can be encoded in a biofilm at the single-cell level
We find that transient light exposure induces persistent and robust membrane potential-encoded memory in bacteria. Similarities between this memory and neuronal memory imply that processes thought to be neuron specific might have early roots in bacterial systems. This discovery could promote biological computation through imprinting of complex spatial memory patterns in biofilms.},

Here, we discovered that the neuronal mitochondrial perturbation-induced systemic mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR.sup.mt) in Caenorhabditis elegans can be transmitted to offspring over multiple generations. The transgenerational activation of UPR.sup.mt is mediated by maternal inheritance of elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which causes the proteostasis stress within mitochondria. Furthermore, results from intercrossing studies using wild C. elegans strains further support that maternal inheritance of higher levels of mtDNA can induce the UPR.sup.mt in descendants. The mitokine Wnt signalling pathway is required for the transmission of elevated mtDNA levels across generations, thereby conferring lifespan extension and stress resistance to offspring. Collectively, our results reveal that the nervous system can transmit stress signals across generations by increasing mtDNA in the germline, enabling descendants to better cope with anticipated challenges.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in science and technology point to the need to unify, and extend, the definition of memory. On the one hand, molecular neurobiology has shown that memory is largely a neuro-chemical process, which includes conditioning and any form of stored experience. On the other hand, information technology has led many to claim that cognition is also extended, that is, memory may be stored outside of the brain. In this paper, we review these advances and describe an extended definition of memory. This definition is largely accepted in neuroscience but not explicitly stated. In the extended definition, memory is the capacity to store and retrieve information. Does this new definition of memory mean that everything is now a form of memory? We stress that memory still requires incorporation, that is, in corpore. It is a relationship - where one biological or chemical process is incorporated into another, and changes both in a permanent way. Looking at natural and biological processes of incorporation can help us think of how incorporation of internal and external memory occurs in cognition. We further argue that, if we accept that there is such a thing as the storage of information outside the brain - and that this organic, dynamic process can also be called "memory" - then we open the door to a very different world. The mind is not static. The brain, and the memory it uses, is a work in progress; we are not now who we were then.},

This general theoretical framework categorizes the memory system along two major dimensions. The first categorization distinguishes permanent, structural features of the system from control processes that can be readily modified or reprogrammed at the will of the subject. The second categorization divides memory into three structural components: the sensory register, the short-term store, and the long-term store. Incoming sensory information first enters the sensory register, where it resides for a very brief period of time, then decays and is lost. The short-term store is the subject's working memory; it receives selected inputs from the sensory register and also from long-term store. The chapter also discusses the control processes associated with the sensory register. The term control process refers to those processes that are not permanent features of memory, but are instead transient phenomena under the control of the subject; their appearance depends on several factors such as instructional set, the experimental task, and the past history of the subject.},

Over the past few years, a reconsideration of this textbook perspective has emerged, in that different timescales of memory-guided behaviour are in constant interaction during the pursuit of immediate goals. Here, we will first detail how neural activity related to the shortest timescales of goal-directed behaviour (which requires maintenance of current states and goals in working memory) is sculpted by long-term knowledge and learning — that is, how the past informs present behaviour. Then, we will outline how learning across different timescales (from seconds to years) drives plasticity in the primate lateral PFC, from single neuron firing rates to mesoscale neuroimaging activity patterns. Finally, we will review how, over days and months of learning, dense local and long-range connectivity patterns in PFC facilitate longer-lasting changes in population activity by changing synaptic weights and recruiting additional neural resources to inform future behaviour. Our Review sheds light on how the machinery of plasticity in PFC circuits facilitates the integration of learned experiences across time to best guide adaptive behaviour.},

General associative memories are flexible and can last for years. In contrast, general short-term memories decay rapidly. We find no evidence of general memory systems used to store sequences of stimuli faithfully. Importantly, seeming limitations of general memory systems may be adaptive as they minimize storage and learning costs. In addition to general memory systems, animals have evolved specialized memories when they need more faithful or longer-lasting memories than afforded by general memory systems. We discuss the consequences of these findings for animal cognition research.},

They recovered a median of 65\% of them 2–3 hrs later, making only 2 errors/seed while doing so. Over trials, they used some sites more often than others, but during recovery they were more likely to visit a site of any preference value if they had stored a seed there that day than if they had not. Recovery performance was much worse if the experimenters moved the seeds between storage and recovery. A fixed search strategy that had some of the same average properties as the Ss' search behavior also did worse than the real birds. In Exp II, any tendency to visit the same sites on successive daily tests in the aviary was placed in opposition to memory for storage sites by allowing Ss to store more seeds 2 hrs after storing a 1st batch. They tended to avoid individual storage sites holding seeds from the 1st batch. When Ss searched for all the seeds 2 hrs later, they tended to recover more seeds from the 2nd than from the 1st batch, demonstrating a recency effect.

Vivid episodic memories in people have been characterized as the replay of unique events in sequential order [1, 2, 3]. Animal models of episodic memory have successfully documented episodic memory of a single event (e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). However, a fundamental feature of episodic memory in people is that it involves multiple events, and notably, episodic memory impairments in human diseases are not limited to a single event. Critically, it is not known whether animals remember many unique events using episodic memory. Here, we show that rats remember many unique events and the contexts in which the events occurred using episodic memory. We used an olfactory memory assessment in which new (but not old) odors were rewarded using 32 items. Rats were presented with 16 odors in one context and the same odors in a second context. To attain high accuracy, the rats needed to remember item in context because each odor was rewarded as a new item in each context. The demands on item-in-context memory were varied by assessing memory with 2, 3, 5, or 15 unpredictable transitions between contexts, and item-in-context memory survived a 45 min retention interval challenge. When the memory of item in context was put in conflict with non-episodic familiarity cues, rats relied on item in context using episodic memory. Our findings suggest that rats remember multiple unique events and the contexts in which these events occurred using episodic memory and support the view that rats may be used to model fundamental aspects of human cognition.},

Setting out to "reverse engineer" the brain -- disassembling it to understand it -- Sterling and Laughlin first consider why an animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from bacterium to protozoan to worm. They examine bigger brains and the advantages of "anticipatory regulation"; identify constraints on neural design and the need to "nanofy"; and demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of neural design at finer scales and lower levels apply at larger scales and higher levels; describe neural wiring efficiency; and discuss learning as a principle of biological design that includes "save only what is needed."Sterling and Laughlin avoid speculation about how the brain{\textless}em{\textgreater}might{\textless}/em{\textgreater}work and endeavor to make sense of what is already known.

The unique geography of Chile encompasses a wide diversity of ecosystems and a rich biodiversity. However, the platyhelminth fauna has been poorly studied. The aim of this work is to compile the historical record of freshwater planarians described for this country. We accessed worldwide databases and published articles to provide a comprehensive review of their discovery history, morphological characteristics and their localities. Freshwater planarians have been collected mainly in central and southern Chile, while in the northern region a single species has been described. The discovery of new species of freshwater triclads has the potential to reveal novel animal models to study regeneration and/or biological adaptations, as some species are suitable for culture in the laboratory. We discuss the many reasons why further research is needed for this animal group, which should include genomic and molecular genetic studies.},

Besides representing an independent research discipline in its own right, understanding of the natural habitat is also directly relevant to optimizing culture conditions in the laboratory. Moreover, the current laboratory models are but few of hundreds of planarian species worldwide. Their adaptation to a wide range of ecological niches has resulted in a fascinating diversity of regenerative abilities, body size, reproduction strategies, and life expectancy, to name just a few. With the currently ongoing establishment of large planarian species collections, such phenotypic diversity becomes accessible to comparative mechanistic analysis in the laboratory. Overall, we hope that this chapter inspires an integral view of the planarian model system that not only includes the molecular and cellular processes under investigation but also the evolutionary forces that shaped them in the first place.},

The brain of these free-living flatworms is a biiobed structure with a cortex of nerve cells and a core of nerve fibres including some that decussate to form commissures. Special sensory input from chemoreceptors, photoreceptor cells of primitive eyes, and tactile receptors are integrated to provide motor responses of the entire body, and local reflexes. Many morphological, electrophysiological, and pharmacological features of planarian neurons, as well as synaptic organization, are reminiscent of the vertebrate brain. Multipolar neurons and dendritic spines are rare in higher invertebrates, but are found in the planarian. Several neurotransmitter substances identified in the human brain also occur in the planarian nervous system. The planarian evolved before the divergence of the phylogenetic line leading to vertebrates. This simple worm therefore is suggested as a living example of the early evolution of the vertebrate brain. An extraordinary plasticity and regenerative capacity, and sensitivity to neurotoxins, provide unique opportunities for studying the reorganization of the nervous system after injury. Study of this simple organism may also contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the human nervous system.},

	abstract = {Here we examine the structure of the various types of spine synapses throughout the animal kingdom. Based on available evidence, we suggest that there are two major categories of spine synapses: invaginating and non-invaginating, with distributions that vary among different groups of animals. In the simplest living animals with definitive nerve cells and synapses, the cnidarians and ctenophores, most chemical synapses do not form spine synapses. But some cnidarians have invaginating spine synapses, especially in photoreceptor terminals of motile cnidarians with highly complex visual organs, and also in some mainly sessile cnidarians with rapid prey capture reflexes. This association of invaginating spine synapses with complex sensory inputs is retained in the evolution of higher animals in photoreceptor terminals and some mechanoreceptor synapses. In contrast to invaginating spine synapse, non-invaginating spine synapses have been described only in animals with bilateral symmetry, heads and brains, associated with greater complexity in neural connections. This is apparent already in the simplest bilaterians, the flatworms, which can have well-developed non-invaginating spine synapses in some cases. Non-invaginating spine synapses diversify in higher animal groups. We also discuss the functional advantages of having synapses on spines and more specifically, on invaginating spines. And finally we discuss pathologies associated with spine synapses, concentrating on those systems and diseases where invaginating spine synapses are involved.},

These have generally some content of extremely low density but occasionally a dense core. 2) Dense vesicles (400–1,200 Å in epon embedded tissue) containing highly osmiophilic granules. Between the limiting membrane of the vesicle and the granule there is always a clear rim of variable width.

Neurons in planarian more closely resemble those of vertebrates than those of advanced invertebrates, exhibiting typical vertebrate features of multipolar shape, dendritic spines with synaptic boutons, a single axon, expression of vertebrate-like neural proteins, and relatively low spontaneously generated electrical activity. Here we report the most relevant contribution to the knowledge of the neuropharmacology of planarians, with particular reference to the behavioral consequences of the exposure to drugs acting on neural transmission. Neurochemical and histochemical data indicate the presence of several neurotransmitter-receptor systems in planarians. Moreover, a variety of experimental studies characterized specific behavioral patterns of these animals following the exposure to drugs acting on neural transmission. There is also evidence of the interactions between discrete neurotransmitter-receptor systems in modulating behavior in planarians. Finally, the model has proved efficacy for investigating the neurotoxicology of the dopamine neurons, and for the initial screening of the neuroprotective potential of drugs. In conclusion, these findings indicate that interactions between discrete neurotransmitter-receptor systems occur very early along phylogeny, although they may have evolved from very fundamental behaviors, such as motor activity in planarian, to more complex and integrated functions in vertebrates.},

Certain organisms such as planaria – flatworms that can reproduce through asymmetric fission – avoid the limitations of this barrier, thus blurring the distinction between the processes of inheritance and development. In this paper, we re-evaluate canonical ideas about the interaction between developmental, genetic and evolutionary processes through the lens of planaria. Biased distribution of epigenetic effects in asymmetrically produced parts of a regenerating organism could increase variation and therefore affect the species' evolution. The maintenance and fixing of somatic experiences, encoded via stable biochemical or physiological states, may contribute to evolutionary processes in the absence of classically defined generations. We discuss different mechanisms that could induce asymmetry between the two organisms that eventually develop from the regenerating parts, including one particularly fascinating source – the potential capacity of the brain to produce long-lasting epigenetic changes.},

These traits combined with their exceptional regeneration capabilities, allow neurobiological experiments not possible in any other model organism, as we demonstrate by electrophysiological recording from planaria with two heads that controlling a shared body. To facilitate planarian neuroscience research, we developed an extracellular multi-unit recording procedure for the planarians fragile brain (Dugesia japonica). We created a semi-intact preparation restrained with fine dissection pins, enabling hours of reliable recording, via a suction electrode. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of planarian neurophysiological research by characterizing the neuronal activity during simple learning processes and responses to various stimuli. In addition, we examined the use of linalool as anesthetic agent to allows recordings from an intact, large worm and for fine electrophysiological approaches such as intracellular recording. The demonstrated ability for neurophysiological measurements, along with the inherent advantages of planarians, promotes this exceptional model organism for neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell. A single pyramidal cell has ∼12,000μm dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40\% are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20\% on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5\% of the pyramidal cells’ dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low (∼3\%). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70–100\%) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77–103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated (∼40\%) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high (∼14–17\%), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},

Efficient clearance of peri-ciliary fluids depends on the precise coordination of ciliary beating to produce metachronal waves. The role of individual dynein motors and the mechanical feedback mechanisms required for this process are not well understood. Here we used the ciliated epithelium of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea to dissect the role of outer arm dynein motors in the metachronal synchrony of motile cilia. We demonstrate that animals that completely lack outer dynein arms display a significant decline in beat frequency and an inability of cilia to coordinate their oscillations and form metachronal waves. Furthermore, lack of a key mechanosensitive regulatory component (LC1) yields a similar phenotype even though outer arms still assemble in the axoneme. The lack of metachrony was not due simply to a decrease in ciliary beat frequency, as reducing this parameter by altering medium viscosity did not affect ciliary coordination. In addition, we did not observe a significant temporal variability in the beat cycle of impaired cilia. We propose that this conformational switch provides a mechanical feedback system within outer arm dynein that is necessary to entrain metachronal synchrony.},

Different species have evolved unique strategies under anatomical and environmental constraints. In this study, we describe a novel musculature-driven escape gait in planarians, ‘scrunching’, which is quantitatively different from other planarian gaits, such as gliding and peristalsis. We show that scrunching is a conserved gait among different flatworm species, underlying its importance as an escape mechanism. We further demonstrate that it can be induced by a variety of physical stimuli, including amputation, high temperature, electric shock and low pH. We discuss the functional basis for scrunching as the preferential gait when gliding is impaired due to a disruption of mucus production. Finally, we show that the key mechanical features of scrunching are adequately captured by a simple biomechanical model that is solely based on experimental data from traction force microscopy and tissue rheology without fit parameters. Together, our results form a complete description of this novel form of planarian locomotion. Because scrunching has distinct dynamics, this gait can serve as a robust behavioral readout for studies of motor neuron and muscular functions in planarians and in particular the restoration of these functions during regeneration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The growing possibilities of space travel are quickly moving from science fiction to reality. However, to realize the dream of long-term space travel, we must understand how these conditions affect biological and physiological processes. Planarians are master regenerators, famous for their ability to regenerate from very small parts of the original animal. Understanding how this self-repair works may inspire regenerative therapies in humans. Two studies conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) showed that planarian regeneration is possible in microgravity. One study reported no regenerative defects, whereas the other study reported behavioral and microbiome alterations post-space travel and found that 1 of 15 planarians regenerated a Janus head, suggesting that microgravity exposure may not be without consequences. Given the limited number of studies and specimens, further microgravity experiments are necessary to evaluate the effects of microgravity on planarian regeneration. Such studies, however, are generally difficult and expensive to conduct. We were fortunate to be sponsored by the Student Spaceflight Experiment Program (SSEP) to investigate how microgravity affects regeneration of the planarian species {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Dugesia japonica{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} on the ISS. While we were unable to successfully study planarian regeneration within the experimental constraints of our SSEP Mission, we systematically analyzed the cause for the failed experiment, leading us to propose a modified protocol. This work thus opens the door for future experiments on the effects of microgravity on planarian regeneration on SSEP Missions as well as for more advanced experiments by professional researchers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The emergence of alternative animal systems for rapid toxicology screens presents valuable opportunities to evaluate how systems complement each other. In this article, we compare a chemical library of 87-compounds in 2 such systems, developing zebrafish and freshwater planarians, by screening for developmental neurotoxic effects. We show that the systems’ toxicological profiles are complementary to each other, with zebrafish yielding more detailed morphological endpoints and planarians more behavioral endpoints. Overall, zebrafish was more sensitive to this chemical library, yielding 86/87 hits, compared with 50/87 hits in planarians. The difference in sensitivity could not be attributed to molecular weight, log Kow, or the bioconcentration factor. Of the 87 chemicals, 28 had previously been evaluated in mammalian developmental neuro- (DNT), neuro-, or developmental toxicity studies. Of the 28, 20 were hits in the planarian, and 27 were hits in zebrafish. Eighteen of the 28 had previously been identified as DNT hits in mammals and were highly associated with activity in zebrafish and planarian behavioral assays in this study. Only 1 chemical (of 28) was a false negative in both zebrafish and planarian systems. The differences in endpoint coverage and system sensitivity illustrate the value of a dual systems approach to rapidly query a large chemical-bioactivity space and provide weight-of-evidence for prioritization of chemicals for further testing.},

Within food-caching birds, it has also been predicted that species less reliant on stored food should have inferior spatial memory and a smaller hippocampus compared to species that depend heavily on food caches. Several comparisons suggest that North American corvids have a significantly smaller hippocampus and overall brain volume compared to the Eurasian corvid species and that western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) have a smaller hippocampus compared to the more specialized Clark’s nutcracker. Here we present the largest data set of scrub-jay brains and, in contrast to previous reports, show that relative to body mass western scrub-jays have a brain size similar to the largest brain size of Eurasian corvids. The relative hippocampal volume of scrub-jays is also among the largest of all investigated corvids. These findings may not be surprising considering that scrub-jays have been reported to have remarkable cognitive capacities such as episodic-like memory and experience projection. Our data suggest that many previously made assumptions about western scrub-jays as less specialized food hoarders might be an oversimplification and that simple categorization of species into specialized and non-specialized hoarders might not provide useful insights into the evolution of memory and the hippocampus.},

Discussions of self-consciousness inevitably lead to Descartes' dictum, “I think, therefore I am”. The goal is a rapprochement between this view and the Cartesian view, emphasizing this kind of consciousness applicable only to humans. Descartes maintained that animals are unable to engage in self-reflection. Negative results of various ape language projects and broad advances in animal cognition suggest that Descartes was right about the uniqueness of language but that he was wrong about animal's capacity for thought and self-reflection. There is abundant evidence that nonhuman pirates can form representations and use them to solve problems. The concept of autonoetic consciousness, as Tulving calls it, seemed close to the construct of self-reflective consciousness and metacognition which was the concern. Thus, instead of focusing on language, more fundamental capabilities are considered—the origins of self-reflective consciousness.},

We describe the main features of each of the two systems, the types of behavior the more primitive temporal updating system can support, and the respects in which it is more limited than the temporal reasoning system. We then use the distinction between the two systems to interpret findings in comparative and developmental psychology, arguing that animals operate only with a temporal updating system and that children start out doing so too, before gradually becoming capable of thinking and reasoning about time. After this, we turn to adult human cognition and suggest that our account can also shed light on a specific feature of humans’ everyday thinking about time that has been the subject of debate in the philosophy of time, which consists in a tendency to think about the nature of time itself in a way that appears ultimately self-contradictory. We conclude by considering the topic of intertemporal choice, and argue that drawing the distinction between temporal updating and temporal reasoning is also useful in the context of characterizing two distinct mechanisms for delaying gratification.},

Previous studies concluded that planaria can be trained to favor a direction in a Y- or T-maze using shock or other negative stimuli, but many of these experiments performed few overall runs and/or tested few individuals. The current study examines whether planaria have a directional bias and the ability to learn by using Y-mazes. The pre-conditioning period determined initial directional bias and was used to assign training directions. The conditioning period used electrical shock as a negative stimulus to condition planaria to select a specific turning direction in the Y-maze. Post-conditioning tested whether planaria maintained their learned behavior. Control planaria were not shocked during the conditioning period. Each period consisted of 3 trials with 10 runs in each trial. When examining the results of a single trial, many planaria demonstrated a directional bias. However, if individual trials for each experimental period were examined together, the majority of planaria were non-bias. Experimental planaria showed changes in their directional preferences during the conditioning period, but returned to their original bias, matching the controls, in post-conditioning. Planaria showed evidence of being trainable, but a total of 30 runs over 3 days may not be enough time for retention to occur.},

Under hypergravity of 3?g and 4?g in a large diameter centrifuge (LDC) planarians can regenerate missing tissues, although a decrease in the proliferation rate is observed.

	abstract = {The planarian Dugesia japonica tends to stay near the walls of its breeding containers and experimental dishes in the laboratory, a phenomenon called “wall preference”. This behavior is thought to be important for environmental adaptation, such as hiding by planarians in nature. However, the mechanisms regulating wall-preference behavior are not well understood, since this behavior occurs in the absence of any particular stimulation. Here we show the mechanisms of wall-preference behavior. Surprisingly, planarian wall-preference behavior was also shown even by the head alone and by headless planarians. These results indicate that planarian “wall-preference” behavior only appears to be a “preference” behavior, and is actually an outcome of spontaneous behaviors, rather than of brain function. We found that in the absence of environmental cues planarians moved basically straight ahead until they reached a wall, and that after reaching a wall, they changed their direction of movement to one tangential to the wall, suggesting that this spontaneous behavior may play a critical role in the wall preference. When we tested another spontaneous behavior, the wigwag movement of the planarian head, using computer simulation with various wigwag angles and wigwag intervals, large wigwag angle and short wigwag interval reduced wall-preference behavior. This indicated that wigwag movement may determine the probability of staying near the wall or leaving the wall. Furthermore, in accord with this simulation, when we tested planarian wall-preference behavior using several assay fields with different curvature of the wall, we found that concavity and sharp curvature of walls negatively impacted wall preference by affecting the permissible angle of the wigwag movement. Together, these results indicate that planarian wall preference may be involuntarily caused by the combination of two spontaneous planarian behaviors: moving straight ahead until reaching a wall and then moving along it in the absence of environmental cues, and wigwag movements of the head.},

Once baseline preference was established for one of two distinctly textured environments (i.e. compartments with a coarse or smooth surface), planarian received pairings of cocaine (5μM) in the non-preferred, and vehicle in the most preferred, environment, and were tested for conditioning thereafter. Cocaine produced robust CPP, measured as a significant increase in the time spent in the cocaine-paired compartment. Subsequently, planarian underwent extinction training, reverting back to their original preference within three sessions. Brief exposure to cocaine (5μM) or methamphetamine (5μM) reinstated cocaine-seeking behaviour. By contrast, the high affinity dopamine transporter inhibitor, (N-(n-butyl)-3α-[bis (4-fluorophenyl) methoxy]-tropane) (JHW007), which in rodents exhibits a neurochemical and behavioural profile distinct from cocaine, was ineffective. The present findings demonstrate for the first time reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking in an invertebrate model and suggest that the long-term adaptations underlying drug conditioning and relapse are highly conserved through evolution.},

Freshwater planarians have emerged as a useful invertebrate model amenable to high-throughput behavioral phenotyping to assay chemical safety in adult and developing brains. Here, we leverage the unique strength of the system to test in parallel for effects on the adult and developing nervous system, by screening ten common drugs and stimulants (forskolin, clenbuterol, LRE-1, MDL-12,330A, adenosine, caffeine, histamine, mianserin, fluoxetine and sertraline) using the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica. The compounds were tested up to 100 μM nominal concentration for their effects on planarian morphology and behavior. Quantitative phenotypic assessments were performed on days 7 and 12 of exposure using an automated screening platform. The antidepressants sertraline and fluoxetine were the most potent to induce lethality, with significant lethality observed at 10 μM. All ten compounds caused sublethal morphological and/or behavioral effects, with the most effects, in terms of potency and breadth of endpoints affected, seen with mianserin and fluoxetine. Four of the compounds (forskolin, clenbuterol, mianserin, and fluoxetine) were developmentally selective, causing effects at lower concentrations in regenerating planarians. Of these, fluoxetine showed the greatest differences between the two developmental stages, inducing many behavioral endpoints in regenerating planarians but only a few in adult planarians. While some of these behavioral effects may be due to neuroefficacy, these results substantiate the need for better evaluation of the safety of these common drugs on the developing nervous system.},

Here, we aim to advocate for the use of planaria as a valuable model for neurobiology, as well. Planarians have most of the major qualities of more developed organisms, including a primal brain. These traits combined with their exceptional regeneration capabilities, allow neurobiological experiments not possible in any other model organism, as we demonstrate by electrophysiological recording from planaria with two heads that controlling a shared body. To facilitate planarian neuroscience research, we developed an extracellular multi-unit recording procedure for the planarians fragile brain (Dugesia japonica). We created a semi-intact preparation restrained with fine dissection pins, enabling hours of reliable recording, via a suction electrode. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of planarian neurophysiological research by characterizing the neuronal activity during simple learning processes and responses to various stimuli. In addition, we examined the use of linalool as anesthetic agent to allows recordings from an intact, large worm and for fine electrophysiological approaches such as intracellular recording. The demonstrated ability for neurophysiological measurements, along with the inherent advantages of planarians, promotes this exceptional model organism for neuroscience research.},

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 million adults in the United States smoke cigarettes, and 4.7 million children have used at least one tobacco product. Abuse of prescription medicines is the cause the death for about 115 Americans daily. While substance abuse tendencies seem transmissible from one generation to next, human studies are challenging due to the long duration and confounding socio‐economic variables. Recent Food and Drug Administration guidance requires abuse liability testing in animals and humans for neuro-active medicines. However, there is no requirement for testing intergenerational transfer of abuse potential. Based on the similarities in nervous system development between mammalian embryos and regenerating planaria, we hypothesized that regenerating offspring of brown planaria parents exposed to substances of abuse (nicotine or ethanol) will demonstrate conditioned place preference similar to parent planaria, making them an alternative model for testing intergenerational transfer of substance abuse potential. Parent brown planaria exposed to nicotine or ethanol showed CPP in a concentration and time-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that regenerating brown planaria offspring are more sensitive than parents to CPP by nicotine or ethanol. In addition, exposure of parent planaria to nicotine or alcohol resulted in CPP in the regenerated offspring, without direct exposure to nicotine or ethanol during regeneration. Based on these results, regenerating brown planaria is a promising alternative model for testing intergenerational transfer of substance abuse potential.},

	abstract = {A key requirement of tissue/organ regeneration is the ability to induce appropriate shape in situ. Regenerated structures need to be integrated with pre-existing ones, through the combined regulation of new tissue growth and the scaling of surrounding tissues. This requires a tightly coordinated control of individual cell functions such as proliferation and stem cell differentiation. While great strides have been made in elucidating cell growth and differentiation mechanisms, how overall shape is generated during regeneration remains unknown. This is because a significant gap remains in our understanding of how cell behaviors are coordinated at the level of tissues and organs. The highly regenerative planarian flatworm has emerged as an important model for defining and understanding regenerative shape mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the main processes known to regulate tissue and animal shape during planarian regeneration: adult stem cell regulation, the reestablishment of body axes, tissue remodeling in pre-existing structures, organ scaling and the maintenance of body proportion, and the bioelectrical regulation of animal morphology. In order for the field to move forward, it will be necessary to identify shape mutants as a means to uncover the molecular mechanisms that synchronize all these separate processes to produce the worm’s final regenerative shape. This knowledge will also aid efforts to define the mechanisms that control the termination of regenerative processes.},

We found that animals exhibited CPP to cocaine at both 1 and 10μM, but not to mephedrone. When examining locomotor activity we found that neither cocaine nor mephedrone treatment showed any evidence of evoking increased motility or locomotor sensitisation. Hypo-motility was seen on the first day of conditioning at concentrations of 10μM for both cocaine and mephedrone, but had disappeared by the last day of conditioning. Examining chronic withdrawal, only 10μM mephedrone had a significant effect on motility, decreasing locomotion on day 2 of withdrawal. Taken together we have shown that cocaine evoked CPP in planaria. We have also shown withdrawal depressing effects of mephedrone on motility.},

Planarians belong to an early branching bilateral group of organisms that possess a simple central nervous system. Furthermore, planarians display various behavioral responses to the environment via their nervous system. Planarians also have remarkable regenerative abilities, including whole-brain regeneration. Therefore, the combination of planarians? phylogenetic position, behavioral properties, regenerative ability, and genetic accessibility provides a unique opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms underlying the anatomical properties of neural morphogenesis and the dynamic physiological processes and neural function. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol for conducting simple behavioral analyses in planarians with the aim of helping to introduce researchers to the utility of performing behavioral analyses in planarians. Since the conditions of planarians impact experimental results and reproducibility, this protocol begins with a method for maintaining planarians. Next, we introduce the behavioral tests as well as the methods for quantifying them using minimal and cost-effective equipment and materials. Finally, we present a unique RNAi technique that enables conditional silencing of neural activity in the brain of planarians.},

	abstract = {Mental illnesses put a tremendous burden on afflicted individuals and society. Identification of novel drugs to treat such conditions is intrinsically challenging due to the complexity of neuropsychiatric diseases and the need for a systems-level understanding that goes beyond single molecule-target interactions. Thus far, drug discovery approaches focused on target-based in silico or in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) have had limited success because they cannot capture pathway interactions or predict how a compound will affect the whole organism. Organismal behavioral testing is needed to fill the gap, but mammalian studies are too time-consuming and cost-prohibitive for the early stages of drug discovery. Behavioral HTS in small organisms promises to address this need and complement in silico and in vitro HTS to improve the discovery of novel neuroactive compounds. Here, we used cheminformatics and HTS in the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica – an invertebrate system used for neurotoxicant HTS – to evaluate the extent to which complementary insight could be gained from the two data streams. In this pilot study, our goal was to classify 19 neuroactive compounds into their functional categories: antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants. Drug classification was performed with the same computational methods, using either physicochemical descriptors or planarian behavioral profiling. As it was not obvious a priori which classification method was most suited to this task, we compared the performance of four classification approaches. We used principal coordinate analysis or uniform manifold approximation and projection, each coupled with linear discriminant analysis, and two types of machine learning models –artificial neural net ensembles and support vector machines. Classification based on physicochemical properties had comparable accuracy to classification based on planarian profiling, especially with the machine learning models that all had accuracies of 90-100\%. Planarian behavioral HTS correctly identified drugs with multiple therapeutic uses, thus yielding additional information compared to cheminformatics. Given that planarian behavioral HTS is an inexpensive true 3R (refine, reduce, replace) alternative to vertebrate testing and requires zero a priori knowledge about a chemical, it is a promising experimental system to complement in silico HTS to identify new drug candidates.Author summary Identifying drugs to treat neuropsychiatric diseases is difficult because the complexity of the human brain remains incompletely understood. Pathway interactions and compensatory mechanisms make it challenging to identify new compounds using computational models and cell-based assays that evaluate potential interactions with specific protein targets. Despite major efforts, neither of these approaches alone nor in combination have been particularly successful in identifying novel neuroactive drugs. Here, we test the hypothesis that rapid behavioral screening using an aquatic invertebrate flatworm, the planarian Dugesia japonica, augments the information obtained from computational models based on the physical and chemical properties of neuroactive drugs. Using 19 drugs classified by the vendor as antipsychotics, antidepressants, or anxiolytics, we found that planarian screening could correctly classify most of the drugs based on behavior alone. For compounds known to have multiple therapeutic uses, planarian phenotyping correctly identified the “off-label” class, thereby uncovering effects that were not predicted using the physicochemical properties of the drug alone. This pilot study is the first to show that behavioral phenotyping in a flatworm can be used to classify neuroactive drugs.Competing Interest StatementE-MC is the founder of Inveritek, LLC, which offers planarian HTS commercially.

Furthermore, the neurochemical response to sucrose binges is equivalent to the one observed in response to the abuse of addictive substances like cocaine. The experiments reported here address the effects of sucrose on an invertebrate model, the Platyhelminth brown planarian. The animals exposed to a 10\% sucrose solution in one context developed a conditioned place preference (CPP) which was subsequently extinguished in the absence of the rewarding agent. However, one exposure to sucrose per se sufficed to reinstate the CPP response, suggesting sucrose-induced CPP can be characterised as a standard Pavlovian response. The same training procedure led to the development of context-specific tolerance to the effects of sucrose. However, comparing animals treated with dopamine D1 antagonist (SCH-23390) with control animals showed that the establishment of CPP, but not the development of tolerance, is mediated by the dopamine reward system.},

In Experiment 1, we assessed the unconditioned properties of different shock intensities by measuring post shock activity. In two subsequent experiments we investigated CPA using different designs, surfaces as conditioned stimuli (CSs; rough and smooth), and different US intensities (5 V and 10 V). In general, we observed the successful development of CPA. However, CPA was stronger with higher shock intensities, and we found that, in our preparation, a rough surface is best at entering into an association with the shock than a smooth surface. Finally, we also observed extinction of CPA. The evidence of CPA and its extinction in flatworms validates the planaria as a pre-clinical model for the study of avoidance learning, a hallmark of anxiety disorders.},

Behavioral responses of freshwater planarians have been studied for over a century.1 In recent decades, behavior has been used as a readout to study planarian development and regeneration,2,3,4,5,6 wound healing,7,8 molecular evolution,4,9,10 neurotoxicology,11,12,13 and learning and memory.14,15,16,17The planarian nervous system is among the simplest of the bilaterally symmetric animals,18 with an anterior brain attached to two ventral nerve cords interconnected by multiple commissures. We found that, in response to mechanical and near-UV stimulation, head stimulation produces turning, tail stimulation produces contraction, and trunk stimulation produces midbody elongation in the planarian Dugesia japonica. When cut into two or three pieces, the anterior end of each headless piece switched its behavior to turning instead of elongation; i.e., it responded as though it were the head. In addition, posterior ends of the head and midbody pieces sometimes produced contraction instead of elongation. Thus, each severed piece acts like an intact animal, with each midbody region having nearly complete behavioral capabilities. These observations show that each midbody region reads the global state of the organism and adapts its response to incoming signals from the remaining tissue. Selective lateral incisions showed that the changes in behavior are not due to nonselective pain responses and that the ventral nerve cords and cross-connectives are responsible for coordinating local behaviors. Our findings highlight a fast functional reorganization of the planarian nervous system that complements the slower repairs provided by regeneration. This reorganization provides needed behavioral responses for survival as regeneration proceeds.},

Nevertheless, to date, very few studies describing their behavior have been led. This work aims to fill the literature gap by providing preliminary results through six behavioral challenges (locomotion, exploration, light stress, planarian light/dark test, shoaling and foraging) conducted with three different species Dugesia tigrina, Schmidtea mediterranea and Schmidtea polychroa. The behavioral responses of every species in each of these six assays were recorded and differences between species were highlighted, depending on the assays and conditions. Schmidtea polychroa is less active than the two others and had the highest light aversion. Reactions observed in response to diverse and realistic stimuli helped us to select the most suitable tests and choose the species that seem the most appropriate for future ecotoxicological and neurophysiological tests. Four tests – out of the six tested- seem reliable in order to standardize planarian behavioral tests.},

Certain organisms such as planaria – flatworms that can reproduce through asymmetric fission – avoid the limitations of this barrier, thus blurring the distinction between the processes of inheritance and development. In this paper, we re-evaluate canonical ideas about the interaction between developmental, genetic and evolutionary processes through the lens of planaria. Biased distribution of epigenetic effects in asymmetrically produced parts of a regenerating organism could increase variation and therefore affect the species' evolution. The maintenance and fixing of somatic experiences, encoded via stable biochemical or physiological states, may contribute to evolutionary processes in the absence of classically defined generations. We discuss different mechanisms that could induce asymmetry between the two organisms that eventually develop from the regenerating parts, including one particularly fascinating source – the potential capacity of the brain to produce long-lasting epigenetic changes.},

Understanding whether sleep is a diagnostic trait for members of the kingdom Animalia has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of sleep and sleep functions. Unfortunately, knowledge on the phylogenetic breadth of sleep is restricted to vertebrates, a few arthropods and molluscs, and one species of nematode. There is a dearth of information on the other 30 or so animal phyla.Here, we provide original data on a previously unstudied group of animals with respect to sleep: platyhelminth flatworms. These free-living animals are relatively simple, with a rudimentary central nervous system and absence of many other specialized physiological systems.Despite this simplicity, inactive flatworms appeared to be sleeping. Specifically, quiescence was organized in a circadian manner, occurring largely during the daytime. This basic rhythm persisted under constant darkness, suggesting that it was endogenously generated. Active flatworms responded more readily to stimulation, and flatworms recovered lost sleep by sleeping longer after a 3-hour period of inactivity deprivation. We were also able to increase inactivity in a dose-dependent manner with exposure to melatonin, a hormone that increases sleep in diurnal animals.Taken together, these data expand our understanding of the phylogenetic extent of sleep and reinforce the idea that sleep evolved early in the evolutionary history of animals. However, additional studies on other types of animals are required for a comprehensive understanding of the origin(s) and evolution of sleep.},

We postulated that Splenda and Equal would produce similar responses and used a tetrad of behavioral assays to test this hypothesis. Acute exposure to a relatively high concentration (10\%) of each sweetener produced stereotyped responses (C-shapes) and reduced motility, with Equal producing greater motor effects than sucrose or Splenda. In experiments testing for anxiogenic-like effects, planarians withdrawn from Splenda (1, 3\%) or sucrose (1, 3\%), but not Equal, and placed into a petri dish with dark and light compartments spent more time in the dark compared to water controls. In place conditioning experiments, both Splenda (0.01\%) and sucrose (0.01\%) produced an environmental preference shift. Maltodextrin (0.1\%), a principal ingredient of Splenda and Equal, produced a significant preference shift. In contrast, sucralose, an indigestible polysaccharide contained in Splenda and Equal, was ineffective. Our data reveal that Splenda produces sucrose-like rewarding and withdrawal effects in planarians that may be dependent on maltodextrin and dextrose. The ineffectiveness of Equal may be due to the presence of aspartame, which is too water insoluble to test in our planarian assay, or to its bitter aftertaste that could mask any rewarding effects produce by maltodextrin or dextrose.},

In this study we analyzed the involvement of the dopaminergic system in the mechanism of action of cocaine in planaria. The dose-related effects of cocaine on planaria motility and the response to cocaine treatment associated with the administration of specific D1 or D2 dopamine agonists and antagonists were investigated. The effects of reuptake inhibitors on cocaine activity were also studied. Planaria specimens treated with low doses of cocaine become motionless, whereas high doses induce a typical behavioural response, identical to the response induced by specific D2 agonists. This response is inhibited by a D2 selective blocking agent. Nomifensine, a specific dopamine reuptake inhibitor, induces a mixed D1D2 response.

	abstract = {Recent research highlighted the impact of ROS as upstream regulators of tissue regeneration. We investigated their role and targeted processes during the regeneration of different body structures using the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, an organism capable of regenerating its entire body, including its brain. The amputation of head and tail compartments induces a ROS burst at the wound site independently of the orientation. Inhibition of ROS production by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or apocynin (APO) causes regeneration defaults at both the anterior and posterior wound sites, resulting in reduced regeneration sites (blastemas) and improper tissue homeostasis. ROS signaling is necessary for early differentiation and inhibition of the ROS burst results in defects on the regeneration of the nervous system and on the patterning process. Stem cell proliferation was not affected, as indicated by histone H3-P immunostaining, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), in situ hybridization of smedwi-1, and transcript levels of proliferation-related genes. We showed for the first time that ROS modulate both anterior and posterior regeneration in a context where regeneration is not limited to certain body structures. Our results indicate that ROS are key players in neuroregeneration through interference with the differentiation and patterning processes.},

Experiment 1 showed that planaria were susceptible to basic conditioning in that they readily developed a conditioned response to a change in ambient luminance when it was consistently paired with an electric shock over a number of trials. In Experiment 2, the change in luminance was presented in a compound with a vibration stimulus during conditioning. Subsequent tests revealed poor conditioning of the elements compared with control groups in which the animals were conditioned in the presence of the elements alone, an instance of overshadowing. In Experiment 3, pre-training of one of the elements before compound conditioning resulted in blocking of learning about the other element. These results add to other studies that have reported cue competition effects in animal species belonging to different phyla (chordate, mollusk, arthropod), suggesting that learning in these phyla could be ruled by similar principles. The results are discussed adopting an evolutionary-comparative approach.},

However, to date, the measured changes have been mostly qualitative in nature and it is not completely clear that the effect is related to stereospecific receptor mechanisms. Methods: The present study addressed these issues by devising a convenient and sensitive metric (locomotor velocity, pLMV) and applied the method to test Planaria enantiomer-sensitivity to a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist. Results: pLMV was remarkably constant over the observation period and established a stable baseline against which to study and quantitate pharmacologic intervention. Further, S(−)-sulpiride at low doses (10−10 to 10−8 M) attenuated pLMV in a dose-dependent manner, but R(+)-sulpiride was only 1/25th as potent. Discussion: The new methodology thus provides a method for quantifying actions of D2 ligands in a simple in vivo system.},

	abstract = {Background
Nicotine is one of the world's most addictive substances and the primary reason that humans inhale tobacco smoke. The pharmacological effects of nicotine can be investigated in planarians, aquatic flatworms that possess an integrated neural network including cephalic ganglia that some consider the earliest ‘brain’ and spinal cord. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nicotine exposure elicits mammalian-like behaviors in planarians.
Methods
Planarian motility and stereotypy (C-shape hyperkinesias) were quantified following acute nicotine exposure. During repeated nicotine exposure, we investigated the presence of withdrawal, tolerance, behavioral sensitization, and environmental place conditioning.
Results
Acute nicotine exposure increased stereotypical activity and elicited biphasic effects on motility. A low concentration (0.01mM) increased motility whereas higher concentrations (0.3–10mM) elicited the opposite effect. Planarians exposed to nicotine (0.03mM) for 60min and then tested in water displayed reduced motility that was not observed during exposure to water, acute nicotine, or continuous nicotine. Nicotine-treated planarians withdrawn from the drug for 3 days before being challenged with nicotine displayed behavioral sensitization at low concentrations (0.1, 0.3mM) but tolerance at higher concentrations (1, 3mM). Planarians conditioned with nicotine in the ambient light (non-preferred environment) displayed a reduction in their natural preference for a dark environment.
Conclusions
The present results suggest nicotine elicits mammalian-like effects in planarians, including decreased motility and increased stereotypy following acute administration and abstinence-induced withdrawal, behavioral sensitization, tolerance, and place conditioning during repeated exposure.},

	abstract = {Planarians display a concentration-related reduction in locomotor activity following their spontaneous withdrawal from opioids, cannabinoids, stimulants and benzodiazepines. This suggests that planarians display a withdrawal-like behavior that can be quantified as a reduction in locomotor activity. Because withdrawal-like behavior in previous studies has been quantified only following the cessation of a 60-min drug exposure, it is unclear whether the withdrawal response varies with drug exposure duration. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine if the duration of drug exposure (0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60min and 24h) to three different drugs – methamphetamine, cocaine and caffeine – affects the magnitude of withdrawal-like behavior (i.e., reduced locomotor activity) in planarians. Experiments revealed that methamphetamine (10μM) produced significant withdrawal-like behavior regardless of the exposure time (P{\textless}0.05). An exposure time of only 5min resulted in a significant reduction in locomotor activity. The peak effect, although occurring following a 24-h exposure, was only slightly greater than that caused by a 30-min exposure. For cocaine (10μM), a longer exposure time (15min) was required for the manifestation of significant withdrawal-like behavior. The peak cocaine effect was observed following a 24-h exposure. Caffeine (10μM) did not produce significant changes in locomotor activity during withdrawal or alter locomotor activity during acute exposure. The present results suggest that the magnitude of withdrawal-like behavior in planarians is dependent on both the duration and type of drug exposure, and that planarians do not display withdrawal to caffeine.},

	abstract = {Chronic nicotine exposure reduces sensitivity to the effects of nicotine, which then results in behavioural changes and tolerance development. In the planaria, a valuable first-stage preclinical model for addictive behaviour, acute nicotine administration has been shown to steadily alter the motility of the animals, a result that has been interpreted as evidence of tolerance and withdrawal effects; however, chronic exposure - typically regarded as a condition for the development of tolerance - and the role of the contextual cues have not been systematically assessed. The present study assessed the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on the motility of planarians (Schmidtea mediterranea). The animals in the experimental groups received long chronic exposure to nicotine (ten daily 30 min exposures); a control group was exposed to water in the same context but in the absence of the drug. The motility of the animals was closely monitored on every exposure. Following this phase, all the animals were subject to three different tests: in the presence of the exposure context (without the drug, Test 1); in the presence of nicotine in the exposure context (Test 2); and in the presence of the drug in a novel context (Test 3). Exposure to nicotine consistently reduced motility; the motility in the presence of nicotine increased with repeated exposures to the drug, an instance of tolerance development. Tolerance development was dependent on nicotinic receptor activation, because it was blocked by the co-administration of mecamylamine. However, this tolerance was found to be independent of the contextual cues where the effects of the drug had been experienced. The results are discussed by reference to the existent theories of tolerance development to drugs.},

	abstract = {Memory retention and transfer in organisms happen at either the neural or genetic level. In humans, addictive behavior is known to pass from parents to offspring. In flatworm planaria (Dugesia tigrina), memory transfer has been claimed to be horizontal, i.e., through cannibalism. Our study is a preliminary step to understand the mechanisms underlying the transfer of addictive behavior to offspring. Since the neural and neurochemical responses of planaria share similarities with humans, it is possible to induce addictions and get predictable behavioral responses. Addiction can be induced in planaria, and decapitation will reveal if the addictive memories are solely stored in the brain. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that addictive memory is also retained in the brainless posterior region of planaria. The surface preference of the planaria was first determined between smooth and rough surfaces. Through Pavlovian conditioning, the preferred surface was paired with water and the unpreferred surface with sucrose. After the planaria were trained and addicted, their surface preference shifted as a conditioned place preference (CPP) was established. When decapitated, the regenerated segment from the anterior part containing the brain retained the addiction, thus maintaining a shift in the surface preference. Importantly, we observed that the posterior part preserved this CPP as well, suggesting that memory retention is not attributed exclusively to the brain but might also occur at the genetic level. As a secondary objective, the effects of neurotransmitter blocking agents in preventing addiction were studied by administering a D1 dopamine antagonist to planaria, which could provide pointers to treat addictions in humans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The brain of these free-living flatworms is a biiobed structure with a cortex of nerve cells and a core of nerve fibres including some that decussate to form commissures. Special sensory input from chemoreceptors, photoreceptor cells of primitive eyes, and tactile receptors are integrated to provide motor responses of the entire body, and local reflexes. Many morphological, electrophysiological, and pharmacological features of planarian neurons, as well as synaptic organization, are reminiscent of the vertebrate brain. Multipolar neurons and dendritic spines are rare in higher invertebrates, but are found in the planarian. Several neurotransmitter substances identified in the human brain also occur in the planarian nervous system. The planarian evolved before the divergence of the phylogenetic line leading to vertebrates. This simple worm therefore is suggested as a living example of the early evolution of the vertebrate brain. An extraordinary plasticity and regenerative capacity, and sensitivity to neurotoxins, provide unique opportunities for studying the reorganization of the nervous system after injury. Study of this simple organism may also contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the human nervous system.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;This experiment examined whether the transfer of DNA or RNA from conditioned planaria could make the recipients more susceptible to similar conditioning. It has been shown in prior experiments that cephalization is not necessary for memory retention in planaria, so there must be another, non-neural mechanism for memory. Thus, changes in DNA or RNA may be responsible for memory retention, and introducing these changes to naive planaria could transfer the \&quot;memory\&quot; of the conditioned donor. This study included 3 groups of 11 planaria: the control group, the DNA receival group, and the RNA receival group. After the control group was conditioned, each planarian’s RNA and DNA were extracted and given to its genetically identical counterparts in the DNA and RNA receival groups. The number of trials it took to condition the planaria in each group was measured and compared to see if the transfer of RNA or DNA made the recipients more easily conditionable than the control donor group. The results show that the transfer of RNA and DNA made insignificant changes to the conditionability of recipients. However, further research may be able to identify the location of memory bearing molecules, which, if applied to experiments similar to this one, would ensure that the planaria received a high enough concentration of genetic material for any changes present to make a significant effect.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {Light matters! Flatworms reveal stunning complexity in light-induced behaviors and comparative processing. Light sensing has independently evolved multiple times under diverse selective pressures but has been examined only in a handful among the millions of light-responsive organisms. Unsurprisingly, mechanistic insights into how differential light processing can cause distinct behavioral outputs are limited. We show how an organism can achieve complex light processing with a simple ?eye? while also having independent but mutually interacting light sensing networks. Although planarian flatworms lack wavelength-specific eye photoreceptors, a 25 nm change in light wavelength is sufficient to completely switch their phototactic behavior. Quantitative photoassays, eye-brain confocal imaging, and RNA interference/knockdown studies reveal that flatworms are able to compare small differences in the amounts of light absorbed at the eyes through a single eye opsin and convert them into binary behavioral outputs. Because planarians can fully regenerate, eye-brain injury-regeneration studies showed that this acute light intensity sensing and processing are layered on simple light detection. Unlike intact worms, partially regenerated animals with eyes can sense light but cannot sense finer gradients. Planarians also show a ?reflex-like,? eye-independent (extraocular/whole-body) response to low ultraviolet A light, apart from the ?processive? eye-brain?mediated (ocular) response. Competition experiments between ocular and extraocular sensory systems reveal dynamic interchanging hierarchies. In intact worms, cerebral ocular response can override the reflex-like extraocular response. However, injury-regeneration again offers a time window wherein both responses coexist, but the dominance of the ocular response is reversed. Overall, we demonstrate acute light intensity?based behavioral switching and two evolutionarily distinct but interacting light sensing networks in a regenerating organism.},

	abstract = {[Introduction] A tail half of a dissected Planarian (Dugesia Dorotocephala) can show a previously-conditioned response after its regeneration, possibly even before maturation of the head and the neural ganglia (Shimojo, et al., VSS ’21). Our results, however, were mainly based on eye examination of their responses to an Electric Shock (ES)(immediate contraction) and UV light (wiggling) before/after conditioning. We now report more objective classification based on machine learning (DNN) to confirm it. [Method] After we conditioned intact Planarians in a Pavlovian procedure with an ES as the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), and weak UV light as the conditioned stimulus (CS), we dissected their bodies into halves. Starting from the 2nd day after dissection, we presented the CS 3 times daily while video-recording the responses. The procedures were automated by an Arduino microcontroller. The recorded responses were then classified by DNN. We used the DNN model VGG16 pretrained by ImageNet for extracting features from images and the classifier. Its three final layers were replaced and trained with transfer learning, fed with labeled video frames extracted from each second of each video. We trained the network with 211 responses to ES and 118 to UV light before conditioning/dissection. The cross-validated accuracy was 83.6\%. We then let it classify responses of the tail halves to the UV light. [Results and Discussion] 99 recorded responses to UV from 20 individual conditioned tails across day 2-3 were analyzed. 96.8 \% were classified as “ES-induced” (against 22.0\% wrongly classified as “ES-induced” for unconditioned samples under UV), therefore qualified to have shown the “Conditioned Response” (p\&lt;3.06E-30). Thus, the classification based on DNN provided objective evidence that the Planarian can conserve and reveal a learned response without the head/ganglia. The results were consistent with the distributed nature of neural pathways and UV sensors (Shettigar, et al., Sci.Adv., 2017).},

Classical data suggest that they may also be capable of long-term memory. Thus, the planarian system may offer the unique opportunity to study brain regeneration and memory in the same animal. To establish a system for the investigation of the dynamics of memory in a regenerating brain, we developed a computerized training and testing paradigm that avoided the many issues that confounded previous, manual attempts to train planarians. We then used this new system to train flatworms in an environmental familiarization protocol. We show that worms exhibit environmental familiarization, and that this memory persists for at least 14 days – long enough for the brain to regenerate. We further show that trained, decapitated planarians exhibit evidence of memory retrieval in a savings paradigm after regenerating a new head. Our work establishes a foundation for objective, high-throughput assays in this molecularly tractable model system that will shed light on the fundamental interface between body patterning and stored memories. We propose planarians as key emerging model species for mechanistic investigations of the encoding of specific memories in biological tissues. Moreover, this system is lik ely to have important implications for the biomedicine of stem-cell-derived treatments of degenerative brain disorders in human adults.},

One explanation for the addition of levamisole to cocaine is that it increases the amount of product and enhances profits. An alternative possibility, and one investigated here, is that levamisole alters cocaine's action in vivo. We specifically investigated effects of levamisole on cocaine's stereotypical and place-conditioning effects in an established invertebrate (planarian) assay. Acute exposure to levamisole or cocaine produced concentration-dependent increases in stereotyped movements. For combined administration of the two agents, isobolographic analysis revealed that the observed stereotypical response was enhanced relative to the predicted effect, indicating synergism for the interaction. In conditioned place preference (CPP) experiments, cocaine produced a significant preference shift; in contrast, levamisole was ineffective at all concentrations tested. For combination experiments, a submaximal concentration of cocaine produced CPP that was enhanced by inactive concentrations of levamisole, indicating synergism. The present results provide the first experimental evidence that levamisole enhances cocaine's action in vivo. Most important is the identification of synergism for the levamisole/cocaine interaction, which now requires further study in mammals.},

	abstract = {More than 90\% of individuals who use cocaine also report concurrent ethanol use, but only a few studies, all conducted with vertebrates, have investigated pharmacodynamic interactions between ethanol and cocaine. Planaria, a type of flatworm often considered to have the simplest ‘brain,’ is an invertebrate species especially amenable to the quantification of drug-induced behavioral responses and identification of conserved responses. Here, we investigated stereotypical and environmental place conditioning (EPC) effects of ethanol administered alone and in combination with cocaine. Planarians displayed concentration-related increases in C-shaped movements following exposure to ethanol (0.01–1\%) (maximal effect: 9.9 ± 1.1 C-shapes/5 min at 0.5\%) or cocaine (0.1–5 mM) (maximal effect: 42.8 ± 4.1 C-shapes/5 min at 5 mM). For combined administration, cocaine (0.1–5 mM) was tested with submaximal ethanol concentrations (0.01, 0.1\%); the observed effect for the combination was enhanced compared to its predicted effect, indicating synergism for the interaction. The synergy with ethanol was specific for cocaine, as related experiments revealed that combinations of ethanol and nicotine did not result in synergy. For EPC experiments, ethanol (0.0001–1\%) concentration-dependently increased EPC, with significant environmental shifts detected at 0.01 and 1\%. Cocaine (0.001–1 μM) produced an inverted U-shaped concentration–effect curve, with a significant environmental shift observed at 0.01 μM. For combined exposure, variable cocaine concentrations (0.001–1 μM) were administered with a statistically ineffective concentration of ethanol (0.0001\%). For each concentration of cocaine, the environmental shift was enhanced by ethanol, with significance detected at 1 μM. Cocaethylene, a metabolite of cocaine and ethanol, also produced C-shapes and EPC. Lidocaine (0.001–10 μM), an anesthetic and analog of cocaine, did not produce EPC or C-shaped movements. Evidence from planarians that ethanol produces place-conditioning effects and motor dysfunction, and interacts synergistically with cocaine, suggests that aspects of ethanol neuropharmacology are conserved across species.},

Using this preparation, we have previously observed acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of sucrose CPP. In the present experiments, we used planaria to investigate the amnestic effects of Heat Shock (HS, a known stressor in planaria) following different amounts of CPP extinction sessions. Experiment 1 showed that planarians developed a CPP response to a sucrose-paired surface. Heat shock, when given in conjunction with exposure to the sucrose-paired surface, produced amnesia as assessed by a subsequent sucrose reinstatement test. We interpreted that the amnesic effect of HS was due to HS affecting the dominant excitatory memory at the time of HS exposure. Thus, we hypothesized that after extensive extinction training (10 exposures), HS would lead to recovery from extinction (when the new inhibitory memory is dominant at the time of HS exposure). Experiment 2 explored this possibility and showed that given HS following 10 extinction sessions had no amnestic effect on the excitatory CPP response. In Experiment 3, we hypothesized that 16 extinction sessions would produce a stronger (and hence dominant) extinction inhibitory trace, which then would be vulnerable to HS. We observed that HS impaired the expression of the extinction memory following 16 exposures. These results reveal different effects of HS on CPP memories depending on the amount of extinction, and are fully consistent with the literature using rodents and humans. In addition, they suggest that planaria is a promising pre-clinical model to assess fundamental memory processes.},

This is the first demonstration of a chemical alarm cue in a platyhelminth. In a second experiment, we exposed planaria to combined cues of sunfish odour and planaria alarm cue, or sunfish odour alone. Planaria avoided the sunfish+alarm cue but did not avoid the sunfish odour, indicating no prior aversion to sunfish odour. When these same planaria were subsequently retested 2 days later with sunfish odour only, planaria that had previously received sunfish odour+alarm cue avoided the cue but planaria that had previously received sunfish odour alone did not. These data indicate that planaria learned to recognize sunfish odour as an indicator of danger based on a single simultaneous exposure to conspecific alarm cue and the novel cue. This is the first demonstration of this phenomenon in a platyhelminth and the simplest nervous system known to be capable of learned risk association.},

Therefore, in this study, we attempted to determine the appearances of DA, 5-HT, and their metabolic products in the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica, characterize the activity of enzymes involved in their metabolism, and investigate the effects of Cd on planarian 5-HTergic and DAergic neurotransmission systems. Only DA, 5-HT, and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were found in planarian tissues. Further enzymatic study revealed the activity of planarian monoamine oxidase (MAO) but not catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). These findings suggest that planarian MAO catalyzes the metabolism of 5-HT into 5-HIAA. However, DA metabolites from the MAO-involved metabolic pathway were not found, which might be due to a lack of COMT activity. Finally, in Cd-treated planarians, tissue levels of 5-HT and DA were decreased and MAO activity altered, suggesting that planarian neurotransmission systems are disturbed following Cd treatment.},

Planarians, like rodents, instinctively spend more time in dark versus light environments when given a choice. This behavioral phenomenon is called negative phototaxis, which may reflect defensive responding related to an anxiety-like phenotype.
New method
We propose a planarian light/dark test, designated PLDT, to predict anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like effects. Experimentally, we placed a planarian at the midline of a Petri dish, containing test compound or water, that was split evenly into light and dark compartments and determined time spent in the light over 10min.
Results
A clinically-approved benzodiazepine agonist (clorazepate; 10μM) increased time spent in the light whereas an inverse benzodiazepine agonist (FG-7142; 1, 10μM) produced the opposite response. Fluoxetine (1μM) or ethanol (1\%), as well as the ‘bath salt’ cathinone S-mephedrone (300μM), enhanced time spent in the light. Planarians exposed to predator (frog) odor spent more time in the dark.
Comparison with existing methods
The light/dark box (LDB) test in rodents is used to screen putative medications for possible anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects. Our results showing that time spent in the light by planarians is enhanced by common anxiety-relieving drugs (e.g. benzodiazepine agonist, ethanol, fluoxetine) and decreased by anxiogenic substances (e.g. predator odor, benzodiazepine inverse agonist) reveal directionally similar effects in the established (LDB) and new (PLDT) assays.
Conclusion
Our data identify the PLDT as a cost-effective, invertebrate assay for quantifying the effects of practically any water-soluble substance on defensive responding and for studying and teaching anxiety-like responses in a living organism.},

The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.},

	abstract = {The mammalian brain is remarkably complex in function as well as morphology, and therefore understanding the original evolutionary function and primitive principles of brain function is an important and classical challenge. The planarian is an emerging new model of the nervous system as well as regenerative biology because it belongs to an evolutionarily early group possessing a central nervous system (CNS), including a brain with simple architecture. Recently, it has been revealed that the planarian brain is divided into several functional and structural domains as defined by the discrete expression of homeobox genes and a surprisingly complex set of genes, and is composed of several types of neurons distinguished by their neurotransmitters and neural modulators, which are conserved with those used by vertebrates. Furthermore, the planarian brain functions as an information-processing center to produce distinct behavioral traits in response to a variety of signals arising from the external environment. This chapter summarizes recent insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate planarian brain formation and function. The relative simplicity of the planarian brain, combined with its molecular accessibility, planarian complex behavioral traits, and advances in planarian stem cell biology associated with the planarian extraordinary regenerative capacity, provide a unique opportunity to unravel molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying fundamental brain function and brain evolution.},

The major excitatory neurotransmitters in the mammalian central nervous system are glutamate and aspartate. We developed a rapid and efficient method for the extraction and measurement of these amino acids in Planaria—a valuable model for mammalian processes because of their simple, centralized nervous system and similar neurotransmitter systems.
Method
The method utilized buffer extraction (perchloric acid containing 0.025\% of l-cystine and Na2EDTA), simple derivatization, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and fluorescence detection.
Results
The mean±S.E.M. amounts of glutamate and aspartate were 322.6±43.6 and 188.6±27.6 pmol/mg-planarian, respectively.
Discussion
The method provides the ability to investigate changes in glutamate and aspartate in response to drug administration or withdrawal.},

With a true central nervous system and simple cerebral eyes (ocelli), planarians are an emerging model for regenerative eye research. However, comparatively little is known about the physiology of their photoreception or how their behavior is affected by various wavelengths. Most phototactic studies have examined planarian behavior using white light. Here, we describe a novel planarian behavioral assay to test responses to small ranges of visible wavelengths (red, blue, green), as well as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) which have not previously been examined. Our data show that planarians display behavioral responses across a range of wavelengths. These responses occur in a hierarchy, with the shortest wavelengths (UV) causing the most intense photophobic responses while longer wavelengths produce no effect (red) or an apparent attraction (IR). In addition, our data reveals that planarian photophobia is comprised of both a general photophobic response (that drives planarians to escape the light source regardless of wavelength) and wavelength-specific responses that encompass specific behavioral reactions to individual wavelengths. Our results serve to improve the understanding of planarian phototaxis and suggest that behavioral studies performed with white light mask a complex behavioral interaction with the environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Hair shaft diameter is one of the most important factors for the outcome of follicular unit extraction (FUE) surgery. In fact, the hair shaft is elliptical. Therefore, it has a long and short axis. Many hair transplantation surgeons use manual micrometer caliper for gauging hair diameter and use the results in the management of recipient and donor area. Aim In this study, we aimed to identify the dependability of micrometer caliper and also the hair diameter diversity pattern in the donor area. Patients/Methods Two hundred and seventy hairs were collected from three males with androgenetic alopecia. Hair samples were obtained from the 1 cm2 boxes from superior to inferior at the mid-point of temporal, parietal, and occipital donor areas. The diameter of each hair was measured both with a micrometer caliper and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results Average diameter measured by scanning electron microscopy was 83.01 µm for the long axis and 51.51 µm for the short axis. The average value for the micrometer caliper measurement was 53.32 µm. Comparison of micrometer caliper results with the short-axis measurements of SEM revealed a strong significant correlation. The hair diameters from superior, middle, and inferior boxes revealed a tendency to decrease toward the inferior regions. Conclusions A manual micrometer caliper is a dependable tool for planning FUE surgery, and it measures the short axis of the elliptical hair shaft. Hair diameter tends to decrease toward the inferior regions of the donor area.},

However, it is unknown whether the potentiation is due to preor postsynaptic changes and there is evidence in favour of each (for example, see refs 5, 6). We now report that intracellular injections of the calcium chelator EGTA block the development of LTP.

Here we present an hypothesis to account for this initial consolidation effect and consider implications that follow from it. Anatomical studies indicate that LTP is accompanied by changes in spine morphology and therefore likely involves cytoskeletal changes. Accordingly, theta bursts initiate calpain-mediated proteolysis of the actin cross-linking protein spectrin and trigger actin polymerization in spine heads, two effects indicative of cytoskeletal reorganization. Polymerization occurs within 2min, has the same threshold as LTP, is dependent on integrins, and becomes resistant to disruption over 30min. We propose that the stabilization of the new cytoskeletal organization, and thus of a new spine morphology, underlies the initial phase of LTP consolidation. This hypothesis helps explain the diverse array of proteins and signaling cascades implicated in LTP, as well as the often-contradictory results about contributions of particular molecules. It also provides a novel explanation for why LTP is potently modulated by factors likely to be released during theta trains (e.g., BDNF). Finally, building on evidence that normal patterns of activity reverse LTP, we suggest that consolidation provides a delay that allows brain networks to sculpt newly formed memories.},

Here we tested whether, as predicted from this hypothesis, induction of LTP by theta-burst stimulation activates an actin regulatory pathway and alters synapse morphology within the same dendritic spines. TBS increased severalfold the numbers of spines containing phosphorylated (p) p21-activated kinase (PAK) or its downstream target cofilin; the latter regulates actin filament assembly. The PAK/cofilin phosphoproteins were increased at 2 min but not 30 s post-TBS, peaked at 7 min, and then declined. Double immunostaining for the postsynaptic density protein PSD95 revealed that spines with high pPAK or pCofilin levels had larger synapses (+60–70\%) with a more normal size frequency distribution than did neighboring spines. Based on these results and simulations of shape changes to synapse-like objects, we propose that theta stimulation markedly increases the probability that a spine will enter a state characterized by a large, ovoid synapse and that this morphology is important for expression and later stabilization of LTP.},

	abstract = {Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules that are critically important for establishing brain structure and connectivity during early development. They are enriched at synapses and, by virtue of a number of properties including homophilic recognition and molecular diversity, have been implicated in the generation of synaptic specificity. Cadherins also participate in remodeling synaptic architecture and modifying the strength of the synaptic signal, thereby retaining an active role in synaptic structure, function, and plasticity, which extends beyond initial development. Cadherins have been implicated in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synaptic strength, a cellular model for learning and memory. LTP is associated with the synthesis and recruitment of N-cadherin to newly forming synaptic junctions, induces molecular changes to N-cadherin indicative of augmented adhesive force, and can be prevented when cadherin adhesion is blocked. NMDA receptor activation, which is critically required for synaptic plasticity, may provide a signal that regulates the molecular configuration of synaptic N-cadherin, and therefore the strength of adhesion across the synaptic cleft. Additionally, there exists at the synapse a pool of surface cadherins that is untethered to the actin cytoskeleton and capable of a rapid and reversible dispersion along the plasmalemma under conditions of strong activity. These observations suggest that synaptic activity dynamically regulates both the strength and the localization of cadherin-cadherin bonds across the synaptic junctional interface, changes that may be crucial for regulating synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {The ability of Aplysia and other gastropod molluscs to exhibit complex behaviors that can be modified by associative learning has encouraged us to search for an elementary behavior controlled by a simple and well analyzed neural circuit that also can be modified by this type of learning. Toward that end, we have now produced classical conditioning in the defensive siphon and gill withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. We used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) a light tactile stimulus to the siphon, which produces weak siphon and gill withdrawal. As the unconditioned stimulus (US), we used a strong electric shock to the tail, which produces a massive withdrawal reflex. Specific temporal pairing of the CS and US endowed the CS with the ability of triggering enhanced withdrawal of both the siphon and the gill. Random or unpaired presentations of the CS and US, as well as presentations of the CS or US alone, produced either no enhancement or significantly less enhancement than paired presentations of the CS and US. The conditioning is acquired rapidly (within 15 trials) and is retained for several days. The conditioned response is abolished completely by removal of the abdominal ganglion and many of the neurons involved in the conditioning have been identified in this ganglion previously. These include the sensory neurons and several interneurons in the CS pathway and the siphon and gill motor neurons of the conditioned and unconditioned response pathways. Moreover, the sensory neurons of the US pathway have been identified in the pleural ganglia. As a result of its simplicity, it should be possible in this reflex to specify neurons that are causally related to the conditioned response. Since this reflex also exhibits nonassociative learning, it also may be possible to compare associative and nonassociative learning on a mechanistic level.},

	abstract = {A behavioral reflex mediated by identified motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia undergoes two simple forms of short-term modification. When the gill-withdrawal reflex was repeatedly evoked by a tactile stimulus to the siphon or mantle shelf, the amplitude of the response showed marked decrement (habituation). After a period of rest the response showed spontaneous recovery. The amplitude of a habituated response was facilitated by the presentation of a strong tactile stimulus to another part of the animal (dishabituation). Many characteristics of habituation and dishabituation in Aplysia are similar to those in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Light matters! Flatworms reveal stunning complexity in light-induced behaviors and comparative processing. Light sensing has independently evolved multiple times under diverse selective pressures but has been examined only in a handful among the millions of light-responsive organisms. Unsurprisingly, mechanistic insights into how differential light processing can cause distinct behavioral outputs are limited. We show how an organism can achieve complex light processing with a simple ?eye? while also having independent but mutually interacting light sensing networks. Although planarian flatworms lack wavelength-specific eye photoreceptors, a 25 nm change in light wavelength is sufficient to completely switch their phototactic behavior. Quantitative photoassays, eye-brain confocal imaging, and RNA interference/knockdown studies reveal that flatworms are able to compare small differences in the amounts of light absorbed at the eyes through a single eye opsin and convert them into binary behavioral outputs. Because planarians can fully regenerate, eye-brain injury-regeneration studies showed that this acute light intensity sensing and processing are layered on simple light detection. Unlike intact worms, partially regenerated animals with eyes can sense light but cannot sense finer gradients. Planarians also show a ?reflex-like,? eye-independent (extraocular/whole-body) response to low ultraviolet A light, apart from the ?processive? eye-brain?mediated (ocular) response. Competition experiments between ocular and extraocular sensory systems reveal dynamic interchanging hierarchies. In intact worms, cerebral ocular response can override the reflex-like extraocular response. However, injury-regeneration again offers a time window wherein both responses coexist, but the dominance of the ocular response is reversed. Overall, we demonstrate acute light intensity?based behavioral switching and two evolutionarily distinct but interacting light sensing networks in a regenerating organism.},
