	abstract = {Addiction is a disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and consumption observed in 20-30\% of users. An addicted individual will favor drug reward over natural rewards, despite major negative consequences. Mechanistic research on rodents modeling core components of the disease has identified altered synaptic transmission as the functional substrate of pathological behavior. While the initial version of a circuit model for addiction focused on early drug adaptive behaviors observed in all individuals, it fell short of accounting for the stochastic nature of the transition to compulsion. The model builds on the initial pharmacological effect common to all addictive drugs-an increase in dopamine levels in the mesolimbic system. Here, we consolidate this early model by integrating circuits underlying compulsion and negative reinforcement. We discuss the genetic and epigenetic correlates of individual vulnerability. Many recent data converge on a gain-of-function explanation for circuit remodeling, revealing blueprints for novel addiction therapies.},

	abstract = {Identifying vulnerable individuals before they transition to a compulsive pattern of drug seeking and taking is a key challenge in addiction to develop efficient prevention strategies. Oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been associated with compulsive-related disorders. To study compulsive cocaine-seeking behavior, a core component of drug addiction, we have used a rat model in which cocaine seeking despite a foot-shock contingency only emerges in some vulnerable individuals having escalated their cocaine intake. We show that abnormal oscillatory activity within the alpha/theta and low-beta bands during the escalation of cocaine intake phase predicts the subsequent emergence of compulsive-like seeking behavior. In fact, mimicking STN pathological activity in noncompulsive rats during cocaine escalation turns them into compulsive ones. We also find that 30 Hz, but not 130 Hz, STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) reduces pathological cocaine seeking in compulsive individuals. Our results identify an early electrical signature of future compulsive-like cocaine-seeking behavior and further advocates the use of frequency-dependent STN DBS for the treatment of addiction.},

Relapse to alcohol or tobacco seeking and consumption after abstinence is a major clinical challenge, and is often evoked by cue-induced craving. Therefore, disruption of the memory for the cue-drug association is expected to suppress relapse. Memories have been postulated to become labile shortly after their retrieval, during a "memory reconsolidation" process. Interference with the reconsolidation of drug-associated memories has been suggested as a possible strategy to reduce or even prevent cue-induced craving and relapse. Here, we surveyed the growing body of studies in animal models and in humans assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological or behavioral manipulations in reducing relapse by interfering with the reconsolidation of alcohol and nicotine/tobacco memories. Our review points to the potential of targeting the reconsolidation of these memories as a strategy to suppress relapse to alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking. However, we discuss several critical limitations and boundary conditions, which should be considered to improve the consistency and replicability in the field, and for development of an efficient reconsolidation-based relapse-prevention therapy.},

The past two decades of research have characterised the details of the molecular pathways supporting the reconsolidation of pavlovian cue-drug memories, with more recent work indicating that the reconsolidation of instrumental drug-seeking memories also relies upon similar mechanisms. This narrative review considers what is known about the mechanisms underlying the reconsolidation of pavlovian and instrumental memories associated with drug use, how these approaches have translated to experimental medicine studies, and the challenges and opportunities for the clinical use of reconsolidation-based therapies.},

We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction.},

The anatomical evidence for independent nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems has, however, long been obsolete. There is now compelling evidence that both nominal “systems” participate in reward function and addiction. Electrical stimulation of both SN and VTA is rewarding, blockade of glutamatergic or cholinergic input to either SN or VTA attenuates the habit-forming effects of intravenous cocaine, and dopamine in both nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic terminal fields participates in the defining property of rewarding events: the reinforcement of memory consolidation. Thus the similarities between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems may be as important as their differences.},

Incentive salience or "wanting," a form of motivation, is generated by large and robust neural systems that include mesolimbic dopamine. By comparison, "liking," or the actual pleasurable impact of reward consumption, is mediated by smaller and fragile neural systems, and is not dependent on dopamine. The incentive-sensitization theory posits the essence of drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological "wanting," especially triggered by cues, without necessarily an amplification of "liking." This is because of long-lasting changes in dopamine-related motivation systems of susceptible individuals, called "neural sensitization." A quarter-century after its proposal, evidence has continued to grow in support the incentive-sensitization theory. Further, its scope is now expanding to include diverse behavioral addictions and other psychopathologies.},

Some of the most compelling examples of experience-dependent changes in behavior and psychological function, changes that can last a lifetime, are those that accrue with the development of addictions. However, until recently, there has been almost no research on whether potentially addictive drugs produce forms of structural plasticity similar to those associated with other forms of experience-dependent plasticity. In this paper we summarize evidence that, indeed, exposure to amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine or morphine produces persistent changes in the structure of dendrites and dendritic spines on cells in brain regions involved in incentive motivation and reward (such as the nucleus accumbens), and judgment and the inhibitory control of behavior (such as the prefrontal cortex). It is suggested that structural plasticity associated with exposure to drugs of abuse reflects a reorganization of patterns of synaptic connectivity in these neural systems, a reorganization that alters their operation, thus contributing to some of the persistent sequela associated with drug use—including addiction.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments in the neurocircuitry and neurobiology of addiction from a perspective of allostasis. A model is proposed for brain changes that occur during the development of addiction that explain the persistent vulnerability to relapse long after drug-taking has ceased. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in the compulsive use and loss of control over drug-taking. The development of addiction recruits different sources of reinforcement, different neuroadaptive mechanisms, and different neurochemical changes to dysregulate the brain reward system. Counteradaptive processes such as opponent-process that are part of normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to form an allostatic state. Allostasis from the addiction perspective is defined as the process of maintaining apparent reward function stability by changes in brain reward mechanisms. The allostatic state represents a chronic deviation of reward set point and is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se, but also by the activation of brain and hormonal stress responses. The manifestation of this allostatic state as compulsive drug-taking and loss of control over drug-taking is hypothesized to be expressed through activation of brain circuits involved in compulsive behavior such as the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.},

We and others have shown that all these neurotransmitters are potent stimulants of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion. The present study was undertaken to examine whether cocaine stimulates hypothalamic CRH secretion and whether or not such an effect is mediated by any of the above neurotransmitters. To accomplish this task, we employed a rat hypothalamic organ culture system, in which CRH secretion form single explanted hypothalami was evaluated by specific radioimmunoassay (iCRH). Cocaine stimulated iCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion with peak of activity at 10−8 M. Isolated or simultaneous pharmacologic blockade of cholinergic (atropine plus hexamethonium), serotonergic (ritanserin), α-adrenergic (phentolamine) and/or dopaminergic (compound SCH 23390) receptor subtypes failed to inhibit cocaine-induced iCRH secretion. On the other hand, cocaine-induced iCRH secretion was inhibited by GABA, a potent inhibitor of CRH secretion, dexamethasone, verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker, and carbamazepine, an antiepileptic and antidepressive agent. These data suggest that cocaine stimulates hypothalamic CRH secretion and that this effect may be related to the local anesthetic properties of cocaine rather than to increases of ACh, 5-HT, NE and/or DA. We speculate that cocaine activates the HPA axis in vivo by releasing hypothalamic CRH.},

For treatments to have long-term clinical value, they must address the causes of relapse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide central to the stress response, may be one key to solving the relapse cycle. CRF is hypothesized to mediate the elevated anxiety and negative emotional states experienced during the development of dependence. This review summarizes existing data on changes in the CRF system produced by drugs of abuse and the function of CRF receptors in regulating behavioural responses to drugs of abuse, with an emphasis on drug dependence. Drug-induced changes in neuronal excitability throughout the limbic system, as well as the reversal of these neuroadaptations by CRF receptor antagonists, are also addressed. CRF receptor antagonists, by reducing the motivational effects of drug withdrawal and protracted abstinence, are proposed to be novel therapeutic targets for drug abuse and addiction.},

	abstract = {Many of the withdrawal symptoms reported by human cocaine users are thought to be correlated with serotonergic dysfunction. To explore the neurochemical basis for this hypothesis, we used in vivo microdialysis to monitor extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of the rat both during and for several hours after unlimited-access intravenous cocaine self-administration. Self-administration of cocaine produced an increase of approx. 340\% of baseline in the dialysate concentration of 5-HT that persisted for the entire 12 h session. During the first 6 h after self-administration, dialysate 5-HT levels were significantly decreased to 41\% of pre-session levels and 25\% of the levels in drug-naive control animals. The effects of cocaine exposure on basal extracellular 5-HT concentrations were also examined using a quantitative microdialysis method (Difference Method). Rats withdrawing from extended-access cocaine self-administration displayed significantly lower extracellular 5-HT levels (0.6 +/- 0.3 nM) than either drug-naive control animals (2.0 +/- 0.5 nM) or animals which received daily 3-h self-administration training sessions only (limited-access; 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM). Together these results indicate that extracellular 5-HT is significantly decreased in the nucleus accumbens during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration. The severity of this decrease is contingent on the length of time cocaine is self-administered.},

Allostasis, or stability through change, has most often been linked with challenges to homeostasis, in which repeated challenges or stressors produce sufficient allostatic load to generate an allostatic state that can ultimately lead to a disease state. The present review argues that the impact of stress on drug addiction fits with an allostatic model and represents a challenge to brain circuit regulatory mechanisms that underlie the emotional state of the animal. The central thesis is that stress leads to changes in corticotropin-releasing factor in the brain that impact addiction. Stress is further argued to impact all three stages of the addiction cycle—binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation—exposing the animal to an emotional allostatic load and allostatic state that forms the growing motivational pathology of addiction. Viewing addiction as an allostatic mechanism provides key insights into the ways in which dysregulated neurocircuitry that is involved in basic motivational systems can transition to pathophysiology.},

Major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine interact with DAT to mediate their effects by enhancing extracellular DA concentrations. We previously identified a novel allosteric site in the related human serotonin transporter that lies outside the central substrate and inhibitor binding pocket. We used the hybrid structure based (HSB) method to screen for allosteric modulator molecules that target a similar site in DAT. We identified a compound, KM822, that was found to be a selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of DAT. We confirmed the structural determinants of KM822 allosteric binding within the allosteric site by structure/function and substituted cysteine scanning accessibility biotinylation experiments. In the in vitro cell-based assay and ex vivo in both rat striatal synaptosomal and slice preparations, KM822 was found to decrease the affinity of cocaine for DAT. The in vivo effects of KM822 on cocaine were tested on psychostimulant-associated behaviors in a planarian model where KM822 specifically inhibited the locomotion elicited by DAT-interacting stimulants amphetamine and cocaine. Overall, KM822 provides a unique opportunity as a molecular probe to examine allosteric modulation of DAT function.},

While the first is commonly administered by insufflation ('snorting') or intravenously, the second is adapted for inhalation (smoking). Cocaine can exert local anaesthetic action by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thus halting electrical impulse propagation; cocaine also impacts neurotransmission by hindering monoamine reuptake, particularly dopamine, from the synaptic cleft. The excess of available dopamine for postsynaptic activation mediates the pleasurable effects reported by users and contributes to the addictive potential and toxic effects of the drug. Cocaine is metabolised (mostly hepatically) into two main metabolites, ecgonine methyl ester and benzoylecgonine. Other metabolites include, for example, norcocaine and cocaethylene, both displaying pharmacological action, and the last one constituting a biomarker for co-consumption of cocaine with alcohol.

Previous reports indicate that planaria shows specific behavioral patterns, analogous to mammalian stereotypes, in response to drugs acting on acetylcholine or dopamine transmission. Here we further characterized these responses, and investigated the interactions between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems by means of behavioral methods. Exposure to cholinergic agonists physostigmine or nicotine produced hypokinesia with ‘bridge-like’ and ‘walnut’ positions, respectively. Blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine produced ‘screw-like’ hyperkinesia. Exposure to dopamine agonists (nomifensine, apomorphine) produced marked hyperkinesia with ‘screw-like’ movements. Finally, exposure to dopamine antagonists produced immobility or ‘bridge-like’ position. Pre-exposure to physostigmine blocked the behavioral effects of nomifensine and reduced and markedly delayed the behavioral effects of apomorphine. Pre-exposure to apomorphine slightly reduced and delayed the behavioral changes by physostigmine. Finally, planaria exposed to atropine after either SCH23388 or sulpiride showed ‘C-like’ or ‘screw-like’ hyperkinesia, respectively. Thus, reduction of cholinergic transmission seems to play a pivotal role in determining hyperkinesia in planaria. Under these conditions, different patterns of hyperkinetic activities occur, according to the subpopulation of dopamine receptors stimulated by drugs. These findings suggest that interactions between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems occur very early in animal phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Cocaine-induced cardiovascular emergencies are mediated by excessive adrenergic stimulation. Animal studies suggest that cocaine not only blocks norepinephrine reuptake peripherally but also inhibits the baroreceptors, thereby reflexively increasing sympathetic nerve discharge. However, the effect of cocaine on sympathetic nerve discharge in humans is unknown. In 12 healthy volunteers, we recorded blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharge to the skeletal muscle vasculature using intraneural microelectrodes (peroneal nerve) during intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg, n = 8) or lidocaine (2\%, n = 4), an internal local anesthetic control, or intravenous phenylephrine (0.5-2.0 microg/kg, n = 4), an internal sympathomimetic control. Experiments were repeated while minimizing the cocaine-induced rise in blood pressure with intravenous nitroprusside to negate sinoaortic baroreceptor stimulation. After lidocaine, blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharge were unchanged. After cocaine, blood pressure increased abruptly and remained elevated for 60 min while sympathetic nerve discharge initially was unchanged and then decreased progressively over 60 min to a nadir that was only 2+/-1\% of baseline (P {\textless} 0.05); however, plasma venous norepinephrine concentrations (n = 5) were unchanged up to 60 min after cocaine. Sympathetic nerve discharge fell more rapidly but to the same nadir when blood pressure was increased similarly with phenylephrine. When the cocaine-induced increase in blood pressure was minimized (nitroprusside), sympathetic nerve discharge did not decrease but rather increased by 2.9 times over baseline (P {\textless} 0.05). Baroreflex gain was comparable before and after cocaine. We conclude that in conscious humans the primary effect of intranasal cocaine is to increase sympathetic nerve discharge to the skeletal muscle bed. Furthermore, sinoaortic baroreflexes play a pivotal role in modulating the cocaine-induced sympathetic excitation. The interplay between these excitatory and inhibitory neural influences determines the net effect of cocaine on sympathetic discharge targeted to the human skeletal muscle circulation.},

The levels of dopamine are low in the brain of some drug users, but whether this represents neuronal loss is uncertain. The areas of the brain involved in methamphetamine addiction are unknown but probably include the dopamine-rich striatum and regions that interact with the striatum.

Researchers are seeking to understand how cocaine's many longer term effects produce addiction's persistent cravings and risk of relapse.

Levels of DeltaFosB in the limbic system correlate with addiction-like behaviors in mice and may precipitate very long-lasting changes to nerve cell structure.

	abstract = {Background
Stimulant drugs can cause persistent changes in the brain. Imaging studies show that these changes are most apparent in dopamine transporter (DAT) or receptor availability within the striatum.
Methods
This work focuses on influences of stimulant use on dopaminergic function assessed using nuclear-medicine imaging (PET/SPECT). Included are 39 studies on 655 cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine or nicotine users, as well as 690 healthy controls. Metaanalyses were conducted separately for D2/D3 receptors and dopamine transporters of the entire striatum, its subregions caudate and putamen respectively.
Results
Meta-analyses results regarding nicotine did not show significant effects between smokers and nonsmokers. In cocaine users there was a significant decrease in dopamine receptor availability in all regions. The striatal DAT availability was significantly increased in cocaine users. Methamphetamine users showed a significantly decreased dopamine receptor and transporter density in all regions. Significant results also indicate a lower transporter availability in all regions. Amphetamine users showed reduced DAT availability in the striatum, as well as in the sub regions.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis provides evidence that there are ongoing changes in the dopaminergic system associated with the use of stimulants. Especially the results of cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine use mainly showed a downregulation. In addition, this meta-analysis is the first to include nicotine. This subset of studies showed evidence for a decreased receptor and DAT availability but no significant results were found in the metaanalyses.},

	abstract = {Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is reduced in cigarette smokers and this may promote the reinforcing actions of nicotine, thereby enhancing the addictive properties of cigarettes. At present, it is unclear how cigarette smoking leads to MAO inhibition, but preclinical studies in rodents show that MAO inhibition increases nicotine self-administration, especially at low doses of nicotine. This effect of MAO inhibition develops slowly, likely due to plasticity of brain monoamine systems; studies relying on acute MAO inhibition are unlikely to replicate what happens with smoking. Given that MAO inhibition may reduce the threshold level at which nicotine becomes reinforcing, it is important to consider this in the context of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes and potential tobacco product regulation. It is also important to consider how this interaction between MAO inhibition and the reinforcing actions of nicotine may be modified in populations that are particularly vulnerable to nicotine dependence. In the context of these issues, we show that the MAO-inhibiting action of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is similar in VLNC cigarettes and cigarettes with a standard nicotine content. In addition, we present evidence that in a rodent model of schizophrenia the effect of MAO inhibition to enhance nicotine self-administration is absent, and speculate how this may relate to brain serotonin systems. These issues are relevant to the MAO-inhibiting effect of cigarette smoking and its implications to tobacco product regulation.},

Recent time-lapse imaging studies of living sensory-to-motor neuron synapses in culture have monitored both functional and structural changes simultaneously so as to follow remodeling and growth at the same specific synaptic connections continuously over time and to examine the functional contribution of these learning-related structural changes to the different time-dependent phases of memory storage. Insights provided by these studies suggest the synaptic differentiation and growth induced by learning in the mature nervous system are highly dynamic and often rapid processes that can recruit both molecules and mechanisms used for de novo synapse formation during development.},

The current study examines whether larval experience can persist through pupation into adulthood in Lepidoptera, and assesses two possible mechanisms that could underlie such behavior: exposure of emerging adults to chemicals from the larval environment, or associative learning transferred to adulthood via maintenance of intact synaptic connections. Fifth instar Manduca sexta caterpillars received an electrical shock associatively paired with a specific odor in order to create a conditioned odor aversion, and were assayed for learning in a Y choice apparatus as larvae and again as adult moths. We show that larvae learned to avoid the training odor, and that this aversion was still present in the adults. The adult aversion did not result from carryover of chemicals from the larval environment, as neither applying odorants to naïve pupae nor washing the pupae of trained caterpillars resulted in a change in behavior. In addition, we report that larvae trained at third instar still showed odor aversion after two molts, as fifth instars, but did not avoid the odor as adults, consistent with the idea that post-metamorphic recall involves regions of the brain that are not produced until later in larval development. The present study, the first to demonstrate conclusively that associative memory survives metamorphosis in Lepidoptera, provokes intriguing new questions about the organization and persistence of the central nervous system during metamorphosis. Our results have both ecological and evolutionary implications, as retention of memory through metamorphosis could influence host choice by polyphagous insects, shape habitat selection, and lead to eventual sympatric speciation.},

When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm DNA from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed CpG hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes.

Experiments with Caenorhabditis elegans, which exhibits robust heritable epigenetic effects, demonstrated small RNAs as key factors of TEI. Here, we discuss three major barriers to TEI in animals, two of which, the ?Weismann barrier? and germline epigenetic reprogramming, have been known for decades. These are thought to effectively prevent TEI in mammals but not to the same extent in C. elegans. We argue that a third barrier?that we termed ?somatic epigenetic resetting??may further inhibit TEI and, unlike the other two, restricts TEI in C. elegans as well. While epigenetic information can overcome the Weismann barrier and transmit from the soma to the germline, it usually cannot ?travel back? directly from the germline to the soma in subsequent generations. Nevertheless, heritable germline memory may still influence the animal's physiology by indirectly modifying gene expression in somatic tissues.},

Basic classical conditioning is caused in part by activity-dependent facilitation at sensory neuron-motor neuron (SN-MN) synapses and involves a hybrid combination of activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and Hebbian potentiation, which are coordinated by trans-synaptic signaling. Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, which might be explained by the known circuit connections in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding. However, for both classical and operant conditioning, adenylyl cyclase is a molecular site of convergence of the two signals that are associated.

Although dysfunction of the dopaminergic valuation system of the brain is known to contribute towards unconstrained reward seeking2,3, the underlying reasons for this behaviour are unclear. Here we describe dopaminergic neural mechanisms that produce reward seeking despite adverse consequences in Drosophila melanogaster. Odours paired with optogenetic activation of a defined subset of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons become cues that starved flies seek while neglecting food and enduring electric shock punishment. Unconstrained seeking of reward is not observed after learning with sugar or synthetic engagement of other dopaminergic neuron populations. Antagonism between reward-encoding and punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons accounts for the perseverance of reward seeking despite punishment, whereas synthetic engagement of the reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons also impairs the ordinary need-dependent dopaminergic valuation of available food. Connectome analyses reveal that the population of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons receives highly heterogeneous input, consistent with parallel representation of diverse rewards, and recordings demonstrate state-specific gating and satiety-related signals. We propose that a similar dopaminergic valuation system dysfunction is likely to contribute to maladaptive seeking of rewards by mammals.},

	abstract = {It has been 70 years since Donald Hebb published his formalized theory of synaptic adaptation during learning. Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation. We then outline areas requiring further investigation on how cellular changes contribute to systems consolidation. Finally, we highlight recent findings on the cellular architecture of memory traces in rodents and how the application of new technologies will expand our understanding of systems consolidation at the neural circuit level. In the coming years, this research focus will be critical for understanding the evolution of long-term memories and for enabling the development of novel therapeutics which embrace the dynamic nature of memories.
The molecular biology of synaptic consolidation is relatively well-defined. By contrast, the molecular mechanisms of systems consolidation remain poorly understood.
Recent technological developments have helped advance our understanding of the cellular representation of memories in the brain.
One of the goals of future research is to clarify how noncanonical forms of synaptic transmission (e.g., exosomally transported RNA, associated RNA-binding proteins, and epigenetic modifications to the transported RNA) may contribute to systems consolidation.
Integrating tools for examining these noncanonical cellular and molecular mechanisms with tools for tagging select circuits of a memory trace will be highly informative for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of systems consolidation.},

Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

On the basis of the survey of the literature, it shows that there are consistent correlations between global changes in epigenetic regulation and the capacity for learning. The chapter suggests that learning dynamics may be reflected by cumulative epigenetic changes at the neuron level. It discusses the implications of epigenetic mechanisms for the study of the inheritance and evolution of learning. The intracellular epigenetic factors and mechanisms are related to the intercellular neural communication that takes place across the synapses that connect neurons.},

	abstract = {A defining characteristic of the brain is its remarkable capacity to undergo activity-dependent functional and morphological remodeling via mechanisms of plasticity that form the basis of our capacity to encode and retain memories. Today, it is generally accepted that the neurobiological substrate of memories resides in activity-driven modifications of synaptic strength and structural remodeling of neural networks activated during learning. Since the discovery of long-term potentiation, the role of synaptic strengthening in learning and memory has been the subject of considerable investigation, and numerous studies have provided new insights into how this form of plasticity can subserve memory function. At the same time, other studies have explored the contribution of synaptic elimination or weakening; synaptogenesis, the growth of new synaptic connections and synapse remodeling; and more recently, neurogenesis, the birth and growth of new neurons in the adult brain. In this review, based on work in the hippocampus, the authors briefly outline recent advances in their understanding of the mechanisms and functional role of these four types of brain plasticity in the context of learning and memory. While they have long been considered as alternative mechanisms of plasticity underlying the storage of long-term memories, recent evidence suggests that they are functionally linked, suggesting the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the brain required for the formation and retention of memories are multifaceted.

However, human language-dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.},

Immunofluorescence study showed direct evidence that acridine orange-stained EV DNAs could be transferred into the cells and localize to and inside the nuclear membrane. However, whether the transferred EV DNAs are functional or not is not clear. We found that EV gDNAs could be homologously or heterologously transferred from donor cells to recipient cells, and increase gDNA-coding mRNA, protein expression, and function (e.g. AT1 receptor). An endogenous promoter of the AT1 receptor, NF-κB, could be recruited to the transferred DNAs in the nucleus, and increase the transcription of AT1 receptor in the recipient cells. Moreover, the transferred EV gDNAs have pathophysiological significance. BCR/ABL hybrid gene, involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, could be transferred from K562 EVs to HEK293 cells or neutrophils. Our present study shows that the gDNAs transferred from EVs to cells have physiological significance, not only to increase the gDNA-coding mRNA and protein levels, but also to influence function in recipient cells.},

While the history of this field is filled with controversies, mechanisms for transmission of information across generations are being elucidated in different organisms. Most strikingly, it is now clear that in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, somatic responses can control gene activity in descendants via heritable small RNA molecules, and that this type of inheritance is tightly regulated by dedicated machinery. In this perspective we will focus mostly on studies conducted using C. elegans, and examine recent work on the connection between small RNAs in the nervous system and germline. We will discuss the evidence for the inheritance of brain-orchestrated behavior, and its possible significance.},

Using C2C12 myogenic stem-like cells, we show that stress memory elicited by transient, low-level arsenite exposure is stored within a self-renewing subpopulation of progeny cells in a mitochondrial-dependent fashion. Importantly, we demonstrate that erasure of mitoengrams by administration of mitochondria-targeted electron scavenger was sufficient to reset key epigenetic marks of cellular memory and redirect the identity of the mitoengram-harboring progeny cells to a non-stress-like state. Together, our findings indicate that mnemonic information emanating from mitochondria support the balance between the persistence and transience of cellular memory.

Serotonin (5HT) triggered growth of new presynaptic varicosities, a synaptic mechanism of long-term sensitization. Following 5HT training, two antimnemonic treatments-reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM--caused the number of presynaptic varicosities to revert to the original, pretraining value. Surprisingly, the final synaptic structure was not achieved by targeted retraction of the 5HT-induced varicosities but, rather, by an apparently arbitrary retraction of both 5HT-induced and original synapses. In addition, we find evidence that the LTM for sensitization persists covertly after its apparent elimination by the same antimnemonic treatments that erase learning-related synaptic growth.

Formation and elimination of synapses reflect structural plasticity of neuronal connectivity. Here we performed high-resolution two-photon imaging of dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex of four macaque monkeys and found that spines were in general highly stable, with low percentages undergoing synaptic turnover. By observing the same spines at weekly intervals, we found that newly formed spines were more susceptible to elimination, with only 40\% persisting over a period of months. Analyses of spatial distribution of large numbers of spines revealed that spine distribution was neither uniform nor random, favoring inter-spine distances of 2–4 μm. Furthermore, spine formation and elimination occurred more often in low- and high-density dendritic segments, respectively, and preferentially within a hot zone of ∼4 μm from existing spines. Our results demonstrate long-term stability and spatially regulated spine dynamics in the macaque cortex and provide a structural basis for understanding neural circuit plasticity in the primate brain.
Reported high resolution long-term observation of dendritic spines in macaque, demonstrated the spine dynamics of L5 dlPFC neurons in puberty and adult monkeys and the spatial rule of spine distribution.},

The manner in which the brain performs these processes has been investigated extensively for decades. Emerging reports suggest that dendritic spines are the structural basis of information storage. The complex orchestration of functional and structural dynamics of dendritic spines is associated with learning and memory. Owing to advancements in techniques, more precise observations and manipulation enable the investigation of dendritic spines and provide clues to the challenging question of how memories reside in dendritic spines. In this review, we summarize the remarkable progress made in revealing the role of dendritic spines in fear memory and the techniques used in this field.},

	abstract = {Abstract Hibernators display severe changes in brain structure during deep torpor, including alterations in synaptic constitution. To address a possible effect on long-term memory, we examined learning behavior and memory of the hibernator Marmota marmota . In two operant conditioning tasks, the marmots learned to jump on two boxes or to walk through a tube. The animals were trained during their active season. Performance improved during the training phase and remained stable in a last test, four weeks before entrance into hibernation. When retested after six months of hibernation, skills were found to be unimpaired (box: before hibernation: 258.2 ± 17.7 s, after hibernation: 275.0 ± 19.8 s; tube: before hibernation: 158.4 ± 9.0 s, after hibernation: 137.7 ± 6.3 s). Contrary to these findings, memory seemed to be less fixed during the active season, since changes in test procedure resulted in impaired test performance. Besides the operant conditioning, we investigated the animals' habituation to a novel environment by repeated open field exposure. In the first run, animals showed exploratory behavior and thus a high locomotor activity was observed (63.6 ± 10.7 crossed squares). Upon a second exposure, all animals immediately moved into one corner and locomotion ceased (7.2 ± 1.9 crossed squares). This habituation was not altered even after hibernation (6.1 ± 1.1 crossed squares). We thus conclude that long-term memory is unaffected by hibernation in Alpine marmots.},

Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM)-related processes such as its consolidation, extinction and forgetting involve changes of synaptic efficacy produced by alterations in neural transmission and morphology. Modulation of the morphology and number of dendritic spines has been proposed to contribute to changes in neuronal transmission mediating such LTM-related processes. Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation and it can affect spine morphology by controlling actin-regulatory proteins. Recent evidence shows that changes in Rac GTPase activity affect memory consolidation, extinction, erasure and forgetting and can affect spine morphology in brain areas that mediate these behaviors. Altered Rac GTPase activity is associated with abnormal spine morphology and brain disorders. By affecting Rac GTPase activity we can further understand the roles of spine morphogenesis in memory. Moreover, manipulation of Rac GTPase activity may serve as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of memory-related brain diseases.},

	abstract = {Memory is attributed to strengthened synaptic connections among particular brain neurons, yet synaptic membrane components are transient, whereas memories can endure. This suggests synaptic information is encoded and 'hard-wired' elsewhere, e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron. In long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular and molecular model for memory, post-synaptic calcium ion (Ca²⁺) flux activates the hexagonal Ca²⁺-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII), a dodacameric holoenzyme containing 2 hexagonal sets of 6 kinase domains. Each kinase domain can either phosphorylate substrate proteins, or not (i.e. encoding one bit). Thus each set of extended CaMKII kinases can potentially encode synaptic Ca²⁺ information via phosphorylation as ordered arrays of binary 'bits'. Candidate sites for CaMKII phosphorylation-encoded molecular memory include microtubules (MTs), cylindrical organelles whose surfaces represent a regular lattice with a pattern of hexagonal polymers of the protein tubulin. Using molecular mechanics modeling and electrostatic profiling, we find that spatial dimensions and geometry of the extended CaMKII kinase domains precisely match those of MT hexagonal lattices. This suggests sets of six CaMKII kinase domains phosphorylate hexagonal MT lattice neighborhoods collectively, e.g. conveying synaptic information as ordered arrays of six "bits", and thus "bytes", with 64 to 5,281 possible bit states per CaMKII-MT byte. Signaling and encoding in MTs and other cytoskeletal structures offer rapid, robust solid-state information processing which may reflect a general code for MT-based memory and information processing within neurons and other eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Complex behavior is associated with animals with nervous systems, but decision-making and learning also occur in non-neural organisms [1], including singly nucleated cells [2-5] and multi-nucleate synctia [6-8]. Ciliates are single-cell eukaryotes, widely dispersed in aquatic habitats [9], with an extensive behavioral repertoire [10-13]. In 1906, Herbert Spencer Jennings [14, 15] described in the sessile ciliate Stentor roeseli a hierarchy of responses to repeated stimulation, which are among the most complex behaviors reported for a singly nucleated cell [16, 17]. These results attracted widespread interest [18, 19] and exert continuing fascination [7, 20-22] but were discredited during the behaviorist orthodoxy by claims of non-reproducibility [23]. These claims were based on experiments with the motile ciliate Stentor coeruleus. We acquired and maintained the correct organism in laboratory culture and used micromanipulation and video microscopy to confirm Jennings' observations. Despite significant individual variation, not addressed by Jennings, S. roeseli exhibits avoidance behaviors in a characteristic hierarchy of bending, ciliary alteration, contractions, and detachment, which is distinct from habituation or conditioning. Remarkably, the choice of contraction versus detachment is consistent with a fair coin toss. Such behavioral complexity may have had an evolutionary advantage in protist ecosystems, and the ciliate cortex may have provided mechanisms for implementing such behavior prior to the emergence of multicellularity. Our work resurrects Jennings' pioneering insights and adds to the list of exceptional features, including regeneration [24], genome rearrangement [25], codon reassignment [26], and cortical inheritance [27], for which the ciliate clade is renowned.

This article focuses on selected recent advances in consolidation research, including the reconsolidation of long-term memory items, the brain mechanisms of transformation of the content and of cue-dependency of memory items over time, as well as the role of rest and sleep in consolidating and shaping memories. Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end.},

Here we combined a local superfusion technique2,3 with two-photon imaging4, which allowed us to scrutinize specific regions of the postsynaptic dendrite where we knew that the synaptic changes had to occur. We show that after induction of long-lasting (but not short-lasting) functional enhancement of synapses in area CA1, new spines appear on the postsynaptic dendrite, whereas in control regions on the same dendrite or in slices where long-term potentiation was blocked, no significant spine growth occurred.},

The usual assumption is that information is transmitted by firing rates. However, rate codes are energetically inefficient and computationally awkward. A combinatorial code is more plausible. If the engram consists of altered synaptic conductances (the usual assumption), then we must ask how numbers may be written to synapses. It is much easier to formulate a coding hypothesis if the engram is realized by a cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism.},

The most widely accepted hypothesis at present is that long-term memory is stored as stable, learning-induced changes in synaptic connections. This hypothesis, the synaptic plasticity hypothesis of memory, is supported by extensive experimental data gathered from over 50 years of research. Nonetheless, there are important mnemonic phenomena that the synaptic plasticity hypothesis cannot, or cannot readily, account for. Furthermore, recent work indicates that epigenetic and genomic mechanisms play heretofore underappreciated roles in memory. Here, we critically assess the evidence that supports the synaptic plasticity hypothesis and discuss alternative non-synaptic, nuclear mechanisms of memory storage, including DNA methylation and retrotransposition. We argue that long-term encoding of memory is mediated by nuclear processes; synaptic plasticity, by contrast, represents a means of relatively temporary memory storage. In addition, we propose that memories are evaluated for their mnemonic significance during an initial period of synaptic storage; if assessed as sufficiently important, the memories then undergo nuclear encoding.

Mechanosensitive proteins that contain force-dependent switches can store information persistently, which can be written or updated using small changes in mechanical force. These mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, scaffold each synapse, creating a meshwork of switches that together form a code, the so-called MeshCODE. Large signalling complexes assemble on these scaffolds as a function of the switch patterns and these complexes would both stabilise the patterns and coordinate synaptic regulators to dynamically tune synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains would operate the cytoskeletal machinery to write and update the synaptic MeshCODEs, thereby propagating this coding throughout the organism. Based on established biophysical principles, such a mechanical basis for memory would provide a physical location for data storage in the brain, with the binary patterns, encoded in the information-storing mechanosensitive molecules in the synaptic scaffolds, and the complexes that form on them, representing the physical location of engrams. Furthermore, the conversion and storage of sensory and temporal inputs into a binary format would constitute an addressable read-write memory system, supporting the view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.},

However, it is unclear which molecular mechanisms allow cellular engrams to encode the diverse phases of memory. Further research is needed to examine the possibility that it is the synapses between engram cells (the synaptic engram) that constitute the memory.

	abstract = {Dendritic spines, the carriers of long-term memory, occupy a small fraction of cortical space, and yet they are the major consumers of brain metabolic energy. What fraction of this energy goes for synaptic plasticity, correlated with learning and memory? It is estimated here based on neurophysiological and proteomic data for rat brain that, depending on the level of protein phosphorylation, the energy cost of synaptic plasticity constitutes a small fraction of the energy used for fast excitatory synaptic transmission, typically 4.0?11.2\%. Next, this study analyzes a metabolic cost of new learning and its memory trace in relation to the cost of prior memories, using a class of cascade models of synaptic plasticity. It is argued that these models must contain bidirectional cyclic motifs, related to protein phosphorylation, to be compatible with basic thermodynamic principles. For most investigated parameters longer memories generally require proportionally more energy to store. The exceptions are the parameters controlling the speed of molecular transitions (e.g., ATP-driven phosphorylation rate), for which memory lifetime per invested energy can increase progressively for longer memories. Furthermore, in general, a memory trace decouples dynamically from a corresponding synaptic metabolic rate such that the energy expended on new learning and its memory trace constitutes in most cases only a small fraction of the baseline energy associated with prior memories. Taken together, these empirical and theoretical results suggest a metabolic efficiency of synaptically stored information.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Learning and memory involve a sequence of molecular events in dendritic spines called synaptic plasticity. These events are physical in nature and require energy, which has to be supplied by ATP molecules. However, our knowledge of the energetics of these processes is very poor. This study estimates the empirical energy cost of synaptic plasticity and considers theoretically a metabolic rate of learning and its memory trace in a class of cascade models of synaptic plasticity.},

Karl Lashley began the search for the engram nearly seventy years ago. In the time since, much has been learned but divisions remain. In the contemporary neurobiology of learning and memory, two profoundly different conceptions contend: the associative/connectionist (A/C) conception and the computational/representational (C/R) conception. Both theories ground themselves in the belief that the mind is emergent from the properties and processes of a material brain. Where these theories differ is in their description of what the neurobiological substrate of memory is and where it resides in the brain. The A/C theory of memory emphasizes the need to distinguish memory cognition from the memory engram and postulates that memory cognition is an emergent property of patterned neural activity routed through engram circuits. In this model, learning re-organizes synapse association strengths to guide future neural activity. Importantly, the version of the A/C theory advocated for here contends that synaptic change is not symbolic and, despite normally being necessary, is not sufficient for memory cognition. Instead, synaptic change provides the capacity and a blueprint for reinstating symbolic patterns of neural activity. Unlike the A/C theory, which posits that memory emerges at the circuit level, the C/R conception suggests that memory manifests at the level of intracellular molecular structures. In C/R theory, these intracellular structures are information-conveying and have properties compatible with the view that brain computation utilizes a read/write memory, functionally similar to that in a computer. New research has energized both sides and highlighted the need for new discussion. Both theories, the key questions each theory has yet to resolve and several potential paths forward are presented here.},

Continuous commitment to creative, adaptive confabulation, from the molecular to the behavioral levels, is the answer to the persistence paradox as it applies to individuals and whole lineages. I also speculate that a substrate-independent, processual view of life and mind suggests that memories, as patterns in the excitable medium of cognitive systems, could be seen as active agents in the sense-making process. I explore a view of life as a diverse set of embodied perspectives—nested agents who interpret each other’s and their own past messages and actions as best as they can (polycomputation). This synthesis suggests unifying symmetries across scales and disciplines, which is of relevance to research programs in Diverse Intelligence and the engineering of novel embodied minds.},

Substantial evidence suggests that memory involves learning-dependent changes at synapses, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, understanding the storages process that underlies LTP may provide insight into how the engram is stored. LTP involves induction, maintenance (storage), and expression sub-processes; special tests are required to specifically reveal properties of the storage process. The strongest of these is the Erasure test in which a transiently applied agent that attacks a putative storage molecule may lead to persistent erasure of previously induced LTP/memory. Two major hypotheses have been proposed for LTP/memory storage: the CaMKII and PKM-zeta hypotheses. After discussing the tests that can be used to identify the engram (Necessity test, Saturation/Occlusion test, Erasure test), the status of these hypotheses is evaluated, based on the literature on LTP and memory-guided behavior. Review of the literature indicates that all three tests noted above support the CaMKII hypothesis when done at both the LTP level and at the behavioral level. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the engram is stored by an LTP process in which CaMKII is a critical memory storage molecule.},

Specifically, understanding how organisms on the lower branches of the phylogenetic tree become familiar with, value and exploit elements of an ecological niche while avoiding harm can be expected to aid understanding of how organisms that evolved later (including
) do the same or similar things. We call this approach basal cognition. In this introductory essay, we explain what the approach involves. Because no definition of cognition exists that reflects its biological basis, we advance a working definition that can be operationalized; introduce a behaviour-generating toolkit of capacities that comprise the function (e.g. sensing/perception, memory, valence, learning, decision making, communication), each element of which can be studied relatively independently; and identify a (necessarily incomplete) suite of common biophysical mechanisms found throughout the domains of life involved in implementing the toolkit. The articles in this collection illuminate different aspects of basal cognition across different forms of biological organization, from prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes-the focus of Part 1-to plants and finally to animals, without and with nervous systems, the focus of Part 2. By showcasing work in diverse, currently disconnected fields, we hope to sketch the outline of a new multidisciplinary approach for comprehending cognition, arguably the most fascinating and hard-to-fathom evolved function on this planet. Doing so has the potential to shed light on problems in a wide variety of research domains, including microbiology, immunology, zoology, biophysics, botany, developmental biology, neurobiology/science, regenerative medicine, computational biology, artificial life and synthetic bioengineering.

Our findings reveal that memory encoding leads to an epigenetic priming event, marked by increased accessibility of enhancers without the corresponding transcriptional changes. Memory consolidation subsequently results in spatial reorganization of large chromatin segments and promoter-enhancer interactions. Finally, with reactivation, engram neurons use a subset of de novo long-range interactions, where primed enhancers are brought in contact with their respective promoters to upregulate genes involved in local protein translation in synaptic compartments.

The animals were trained in summer to successfully accomplish two tasks: a spatial memory task in a maze and an operant task on a feeding machine. One group hibernated normally, and the other was prevented from hibernation by maintaining ambient temperature at 22 degrees C. In spring, the same tasks were repeated for both groups and their individual performances compared to the initial training phase. The experimental groups differed significantly in both tasks. The nonhibernating animals had higher levels of retention and needed significantly fewer trials to relearn the tasks than the group that had hibernated. In addition to testing the retention of conditioned tasks, social memory was also studied. The ground squirrels were given a social recognition test in spring with one familiar and one unfamiliar conspecific. In contrast to the conditioned tasks, social memory did not seem to be affected by hibernation. The results indicate negative effects of hibernation on the retention of conditioned tasks, which could produce important constraints on animals. A potential explanation for this memory loss might be changes in neuronal activity, which occur during hibernation.},

According to the synaptic trace theory of memory, activity-induced changes in the pattern of synaptic connections underlie the storage of information for long periods. In this framework, the stability of memory critically depends on the stability of the underlying synaptic connections. Surprisingly however, synaptic connections in the living brain are highly volatile, which poses a fundamental challenge to the synaptic trace theory. Here we review recent experimental evidence that link the initial formation of a memory with changes in the pattern of connectivity, but also evidence that synaptic connections are considerably volatile even in the absence of learning. Then we consider different theoretical models that have been put forward to explain how memory can be maintained with such volatile building blocks.},

C. elegans protects itself from pathogens by “reading” bacterial small RNAs, using this information to both induce avoidance and transmit memories for four generations. Here, we found that memories can be transferred from either lysed animals or from conditioned media to naive animals via Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. Moreover, Cer1 functions internally at the step of transmission of information from the germline to neurons and is required for learned avoidance. The presence of the Cer1 retrotransposon in wild C. elegans strains correlates with the ability to learn and inherit small-RNA-induced pathogen avoidance. Together, these results suggest that C. elegans has co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to instead protect itself and its progeny from a common pathogen through its inter-tissue signaling ability, hijacking this genomic element for its own adaptive immunity benefit.

cis
-regulatory influence of activated transposable elements on gene expression, as well as insertions into new genomic loci near the genes involved in brain functioning. RNAs and proteins of endogenous retroviruses are transported to dendritic synapses and transmit information to change gene expression in neighboring cells through the formation of virus-like particles in vesicles. Because of this, the relationship between synaptic plasticity and nuclear coding is ensured, since transposable elements are also drivers of epigenetic regulation owing to the relationship to the noncoding RNAs derived from them. Our analysis of the scientific literature allowed us to identify the role of 17 microRNAs derived from transposable elements in normal memory formation. In neurodegenerative diseases with memory impairment, we identified impaired expression of 44 microRNAs derived from transposable elements. This demonstrates the potential for targeting pathological transposon activation in neurodegenerative diseases for memory restoration using microRNAs as tools.},

First, excessive dopamine signaling during drug use may modulate gene expression, altering synaptic function and circuit activity and leading over time to maladaptive behaviors in vulnerable individuals. Second, on a longer timescale, life experience can shape the epigenetic landscape in brain and thereby may contribute to an individual’s vulnerability by amplifying drug-induced changes in gene expression that drive the transition to addiction. We conclude by exploring how epigenetic mechanisms might serve as therapeutic targets for addiction treatments.

	abstract = {Memories of past experiences guide future behaviour. Sparse ensembles of neurons, known as engrams, are thought to store memories in the brain. Neurons involved in a particular engram (“engram neurons”) are necessary for subsequent memory expression as memory retrieval is thought to be initiated by an external sensory cue reactivating engram neurons. However, conditions or environments are dynamic, such that future behaviour should be flexible. The role of engrams in mediating flexible behaviour is not understood. Here we examined this question using one type of flexible behaviour, extinction of a threat response. An initially neutral tone is first paired with an aversive footshock such that the tone alone induces defensive freezing. After subsequent repeated tone presentations without the footshock, rodents no longer freeze to the tone. Because the tone cue is thought to reactivate the engram to induce memory retrieval, we examined whether it is possible to induce an extinction-like behavioural effect by optogenetically reactivating the lateral amygdala component of the engram alone (without tone re-exposure). Similar to tone-induced extinction, mice showed decreased freezing to optogenetic stimulation of the lateral amygdala engram in the “extinction training” session. Moreover, “opto-extinguished” mice showed decreased freezing to the tone when subsequently tested for retrieval of the extinction training in the same context, suggesting that the opto-extinction transferred to the actual sensory stimulus. However, unlike tone extinction, in which mice showed renewal of tone-induced freezing when tested in a novel context, opto-extinguished mice continued to show a deficit in tone-induced freezing. Extinction has been characterized as new learning that inhibits the original memory or a phenomenon in which the original memory is "unlearned". Our findings suggest that opto-extinction may silence the original engram to “unlearn” the original memory.},

	abstract = {It is unknown whether the activity of the nervous system can be inherited. In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, parental responses can transmit heritable small RNAs that regulate gene expression transgenerationally. In this study, we show that a neuronal process can impact the next generations. Neurons-specific synthesis of RDE-4-dependent small RNAs regulates germline amplified endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and germline gene expression for multiple generations. Further, the production of small RNAs in neurons controls the chemotaxis behavior of the progeny for at least three generations via the germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Among the targets of these small RNAs, we identified the conserved gene saeg-2, which is transgenerationally downregulated in the germline. Silencing of saeg-2 following neuronal small RNA biogenesis is required for chemotaxis under stress. Thus, we propose a small-RNA-based mechanism for communication of neuronal processes transgenerationally.

	abstract = {Turnover—constant component production and destruction—is ubiquitous in biology. Turnover occurs across organisms and scales, including for RNAs, proteins, membranes, macromolecular structures, organelles, cells, hair, feathers, nails, antlers, and teeth. For many systems, turnover might seem wasteful when degraded components are often fully functional. Some components turn over with shockingly high rates and others do not turn over at all, further making this process enigmatic. However, turnover can address fundamental problems by yielding powerful properties, including regeneration, rapid repair onset, clearance of unpredictable damage and errors, maintenance of low constitutive levels of disrepair, prevention of stable hazards, and transitions. I argue that trade-offs between turnover benefits and metabolic costs, combined with constraints on turnover, determine its presence and rates across distinct contexts. I suggest that the limits of turnover help explain aging and that turnover properties and the basis for its levels underlie this fundamental component of life.
Biological systems are constantly building and destroying components. Whereas this turnover might at first seem needlessly wasteful, because degraded components are often fully functional, this Perspective describes a framework for conceptualizing how turnover at multiple scales can address fundamental challenges to maintain systems and for the basis for turnover levels.},

Now, there is accumulating evidence that in the CNS, these same mechanisms may be pivotal for drug-induced changes in gene expression and ultimately long-term behavioral changes. As these mechanisms are also being found to be fundamental for learning and memory, an exciting new possibility is the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by manipulation of epigenetic mechanisms.

The finding that spine density decreases between young and adult ages in fixed tissues suggested that spines are dynamic. It is only a decade ago that two-photon microscopy (TPM) has unambiguously proven the dynamic nature of spines, through the repeated imaging of single spines in live animals. Spine dynamics comprise formation, disappearance, and stabilization of spines and are modulated by neuronal activity and developmental age. Here, we review several emerging concepts in the field that start to answer the following key questions: What are the external signals triggering spine dynamics and the molecular mechanisms involved? What is, in return, the role of spine dynamics in circuit-rewiring, learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders?},

Despite being a cornerstone of brain function, questions surrounding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how information is encoded, stored, and recalled remain largely unanswered. One widely held theory is that an engram is formed by a group of neurons that are active during learning, which undergoes biochemical and physical changes to store information in a stable state, and that are later reactivated during recall of the memory. In the past decade, the development of engram labeling methodologies has proven useful to investigate the biology of memory at the molecular and cellular levels. Engram technology allows the study of individual memories associated with particular experiences and their evolution over time, with enough experimental resolution to discriminate between different memory processes: learning (encoding), consolidation (the passage from short-term to long-term memories), and storage (the maintenance of memory in the brain).

To assess the prevalence and identity of transferred proteins and the cellular specificity of transfer, we biotinylated retinal ganglion cell proteins in vivo and examined biotinylated proteins transported through the rodent visual circuit using microscopy, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy demonstrated preferential transfer of biotinylated proteins from retinogeniculate inputs to excitatory lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons compared with GABAergic neurons. An unbiased mass spectrometry-based screen identified ∼200 transneuronally transported proteins (TNTPs) isolated from the visual cortex. The majority of TNTPs are present in neuronal exosomes, and virally expressed TNTPs, including tau and β-synuclein, were detected in isolated exosomes and postsynaptic neurons. Our data demonstrate transfer of diverse endogenous proteins between neurons in the healthy intact brain and suggest that TNTP transport may be mediated by exosomes.

However, microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; endo-siRNAs, piRNAs, BC1, BC200, antisense and long ncRNAs, repeat-related transcripts, etc.) regulate mRNAs via effects on protein translation as well as transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Not only are genes ON or OFF, but their ability to be translated can be turned ON or OFF at the level of synapses, supporting an enormous increase in information capacity. Here, I review evidence that ncRNAs are expressed pervasively within dendrites in mammalian brain; that some are activity-dependent and highly enriched near synapses; and that synaptic ncRNAs participate in plasticity responses including learning and memory. Ultimately, ncRNAs can be viewed as the post-it notes of the neuron. They have no literal meaning of their own, but derive their functions from where (and to what) they are stuck. This may explain, in part, why ncRNAs differ so dramatically from protein-coding genes, both in terms of the usual indicators of functionality and in terms of evolutionary constraints. ncRNAs do not appear to be direct mediators of synaptic transmission in the manner of neurotransmitters or receptors, yet they orchestrate synaptic plasticity—and may drive species-specific changes in cognition.},

	abstract = {Stimuli that stimulate neurons elicit transcription of immediate-early genes, a process which requires local sites of chromosomal DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by topoisomerase IIb within a few minutes, followed by repair within a few hours. Wakefulness, exploring a novel environment, and contextual fear conditioning also elicit turn-on of synaptic genes requiring DSBs and repair. It has been reported (in non-neuronal cells) that extrachromosomal circular DNA can form at DSBs as the sites are repaired. I propose that activated neurons may generate extrachromosomal circular DNAs during repair at DSB sites, thus creating long-lasting "markers" of that activity pattern which contain sequences from their sites of origin and which regulate long-term gene expression. Although the population of extrachromosomal DNAs is diverse and overall associated with pathology, a subclass of small circular DNAs ("microDNAs," ∼100-400 bases long), largely derives from unique genomic sequences and has attractive features to act as stable, mobile circular DNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Circular DNAs can be templates for the transcription of RNAs, particularly small inhibitory siRNAs, circular RNAs and other non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNAs. These may regulate translation and transcription of other genes involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Another possible fate for mobile DNAs is to be inserted stably into chromosomes after new DSB sites are generated in response to subsequent activation events. Thus, the insertions of mobile DNAs into activity-induced genes may tend to inactivate them and aid in homeostatic regulation to avoid over-excitation, as well as providing a "counter" for a neuron's activation history. Moreover, activated neurons release secretory exosomes that can be transferred to recipient cells to regulate their gene expression. Mobile DNAs may be packaged into exosomes, released in an activity-dependent manner, and transferred to recipient cells, where they may be templates for regulatory RNAs and possibly incorporated into chromosomes. Finally, aging and neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) are also associated with an increase in DSBs in neurons. It will become important in the future to assess how pathology-associated DSBs may relate to activity-induced mobile DNAs, and whether the latter may potentially contribute to pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon described as interanimal transfer of learned responses from trained donor animals to untrained recipient animals by means of brain extracts has been regarded as problematic by many investigators and has generated extensive literature. Among major issues have been the reproducibility of the phenomenon and the viability of a learning interpretation of the recipients' behavior. The learning interpretation, if correct, makes direct experimental approaches to brain-behavior relationships feasible in the context of learning and memory. The review led to a number of conclusions with respect to the issues and evidence. Reproducibility has become less of a problem but has not been eliminated. Several species have been used successfully, and the effect has been reported over a wide range of tasks. The transfer effect, considered at a behavioral level of analysis, exhibits an empirical relationship with donor training and learning. While there is also evidence of a transfer of a nonspecific arousal factor, it cannot account for all of the data. Given the relatively crude extracts used in many cases, a 2-factor explanation of transfer appears most likely, in which an arousal transfer occurs under one set of conditions, and a learning transfer under others. The behavioral challenge resulting from this notion is the clear separation of the 2 effects. Biological and chemical mechanisms of the effect have not been widely researched, possibly due to a lack of formal consensus about what the transfer effect represents and thus its significance.

From the perspective of what we might call "classical cognitive science" it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists' doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists' objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented. On this basis, a novel way of thinking about the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory is proposed.},

	abstract = {Cellular membrane potential plays a key role in the formation and retrieval of memories in the metazoan brain, but it remains unclear whether such memory can also be encoded in simpler organisms like bacteria. Here, we show that single-cell-level memory patterns can be imprinted in bacterial biofilms by light-induced changes in the membrane potential. We demonstrate that transient optical perturbations generate a persistent and robust potassium-channel-mediated change in the membrane potential of bacteria within the biofilm. The light-exposed cells respond in an anti-phase manner, relative to unexposed cells, to both natural and induced oscillations in extracellular ion concentrations. This anti-phase response, which persists for hours following the transient optical stimulus, enables a direct single-cell resolution visualization of spatial memory patterns within the biofilm. The ability to encode robust and persistent membrane-potential-based memory patterns could enable computations within prokaryotic communities and suggests a parallel between neurons and bacteria.

•Bacteria form membrane-potential-based memory, reminiscent of neurons•Bacterial memory is formed through a light-induced change to potassium channels•As predicted by a Hodgkin-Huxley model, memory is robust to ionic perturbations•Complex memory patterns can be encoded in a biofilm at the single-cell level
We find that transient light exposure induces persistent and robust membrane potential-encoded memory in bacteria. Similarities between this memory and neuronal memory imply that processes thought to be neuron specific might have early roots in bacterial systems.

Here, we discovered that the neuronal mitochondrial perturbation-induced systemic mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR.sup.mt) in Caenorhabditis elegans can be transmitted to offspring over multiple generations. The transgenerational activation of UPR.sup.mt is mediated by maternal inheritance of elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which causes the proteostasis stress within mitochondria. Furthermore, results from intercrossing studies using wild C. elegans strains further support that maternal inheritance of higher levels of mtDNA can induce the UPR.sup.mt in descendants. The mitokine Wnt signalling pathway is required for the transmission of elevated mtDNA levels across generations, thereby conferring lifespan extension and stress resistance to offspring. Collectively, our results reveal that the nervous system can transmit stress signals across generations by increasing mtDNA in the germline, enabling descendants to better cope with anticipated challenges.},

On the one hand, molecular neurobiology has shown that memory is largely a neuro-chemical process, which includes conditioning and any form of stored experience. On the other hand, information technology has led many to claim that cognition is also extended, that is, memory may be stored outside of the brain. In this paper, we review these advances and describe an extended definition of memory. This definition is largely accepted in neuroscience but not explicitly stated. In the extended definition, memory is the capacity to store and retrieve information. Does this new definition of memory mean that everything is now a form of memory? We stress that memory still requires incorporation, that is, in corpore. It is a relationship - where one biological or chemical process is incorporated into another, and changes both in a permanent way. Looking at natural and biological processes of incorporation can help us think of how incorporation of internal and external memory occurs in cognition. We further argue that, if we accept that there is such a thing as the storage of information outside the brain - and that this organic, dynamic process can also be called "memory" - then we open the door to a very different world. The mind is not static. The brain, and the memory it uses, is a work in progress; we are not now who we were then.},

This general theoretical framework categorizes the memory system along two major dimensions. The first categorization distinguishes permanent, structural features of the system from control processes that can be readily modified or reprogrammed at the will of the subject. The second categorization divides memory into three structural components: the sensory register, the short-term store, and the long-term store. Incoming sensory information first enters the sensory register, where it resides for a very brief period of time, then decays and is lost. The short-term store is the subject's working memory; it receives selected inputs from the sensory register and also from long-term store. The chapter also discusses the control processes associated with the sensory register. The term control process refers to those processes that are not permanent features of memory, but are instead transient phenomena under the control of the subject; their appearance depends on several factors such as instructional set, the experimental task, and the past history of the subject.},

Over the past few years, a reconsideration of this textbook perspective has emerged, in that different timescales of memory-guided behaviour are in constant interaction during the pursuit of immediate goals. Here, we will first detail how neural activity related to the shortest timescales of goal-directed behaviour (which requires maintenance of current states and goals in working memory) is sculpted by long-term knowledge and learning — that is, how the past informs present behaviour. Then, we will outline how learning across different timescales (from seconds to years) drives plasticity in the primate lateral PFC, from single neuron firing rates to mesoscale neuroimaging activity patterns. Finally, we will review how, over days and months of learning, dense local and long-range connectivity patterns in PFC facilitate longer-lasting changes in population activity by changing synaptic weights and recruiting additional neural resources to inform future behaviour. Our Review sheds light on how the machinery of plasticity in PFC circuits facilitates the integration of learned experiences across time to best guide adaptive behaviour.},

General associative memories are flexible and can last for years. In contrast, general short-term memories decay rapidly. We find no evidence of general memory systems used to store sequences of stimuli faithfully. Importantly, seeming limitations of general memory systems may be adaptive as they minimize storage and learning costs. In addition to general memory systems, animals have evolved specialized memories when they need more faithful or longer-lasting memories than afforded by general memory systems.

They recovered a median of 65\% of them 2–3 hrs later, making only 2 errors/seed while doing so. Over trials, they used some sites more often than others, but during recovery they were more likely to visit a site of any preference value if they had stored a seed there that day than if they had not. Recovery performance was much worse if the experimenters moved the seeds between storage and recovery. A fixed search strategy that had some of the same average properties as the Ss' search behavior also did worse than the real birds. In Exp II, any tendency to visit the same sites on successive daily tests in the aviary was placed in opposition to memory for storage sites by allowing Ss to store more seeds 2 hrs after storing a 1st batch. They tended to avoid individual storage sites holding seeds from the 1st batch.

Vivid episodic memories in people have been characterized as the replay of unique events in sequential order [1, 2, 3]. Animal models of episodic memory have successfully documented episodic memory of a single event (e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). However, a fundamental feature of episodic memory in people is that it involves multiple events, and notably, episodic memory impairments in human diseases are not limited to a single event. Critically, it is not known whether animals remember many unique events using episodic memory. Here, we show that rats remember many unique events and the contexts in which the events occurred using episodic memory. We used an olfactory memory assessment in which new (but not old) odors were rewarded using 32 items. Rats were presented with 16 odors in one context and the same odors in a second context. To attain high accuracy, the rats needed to remember item in context because each odor was rewarded as a new item in each context. The demands on item-in-context memory were varied by assessing memory with 2, 3, 5, or 15 unpredictable transitions between contexts, and item-in-context memory survived a 45 min retention interval challenge. When the memory of item in context was put in conflict with non-episodic familiarity cues, rats relied on item in context using episodic memory. Our findings suggest that rats remember multiple unique events and the contexts in which these events occurred using episodic memory and support the view that rats may be used to model fundamental aspects of human cognition.},

And yet a principled framework to organize this knowledge has been missing. In this book, Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin, two leading neuroscientists, strive to fill this gap, outlining a set of organizing principles to explain the whys of neural design that allow the brain to compute so efficiently. Setting out to "reverse engineer" the brain -- disassembling it to understand it -- Sterling and Laughlin first consider why an animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from bacterium to protozoan to worm. They examine bigger brains and the advantages of "anticipatory regulation"; identify constraints on neural design and the need to "nanofy"; and demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of neural design at finer scales and lower levels apply at larger scales and higher levels; describe neural wiring efficiency; and discuss learning as a principle of biological design that includes "save only what is needed."Sterling and Laughlin avoid speculation about how the brain{\textless}em{\textgreater}might{\textless}/em{\textgreater}work and endeavor to make sense of what is already known. Their distinctive contribution is to gather a coherent set of basic rules and exemplify them across spatial and functional scales.},

The unique geography of Chile encompasses a wide diversity of ecosystems and a rich biodiversity. However, the platyhelminth fauna has been poorly studied. The aim of this work is to compile the historical record of freshwater planarians described for this country. We accessed worldwide databases and published articles to provide a comprehensive review of their discovery history, morphological characteristics and their localities. Freshwater planarians have been collected mainly in central and southern Chile, while in the northern region a single species has been described. The discovery of new species of freshwater triclads has the potential to reveal novel animal models to study regeneration and/or biological adaptations, as some species are suitable for culture in the laboratory. We discuss the many reasons why further research is needed for this animal group, which should include genomic and molecular genetic studies.},

Besides representing an independent research discipline in its own right, understanding of the natural habitat is also directly relevant to optimizing culture conditions in the laboratory. Moreover, the current laboratory models are but few of hundreds of planarian species worldwide. Their adaptation to a wide range of ecological niches has resulted in a fascinating diversity of regenerative abilities, body size, reproduction strategies, and life expectancy, to name just a few. With the currently ongoing establishment of large planarian species collections, such phenotypic diversity becomes accessible to comparative mechanistic analysis in the laboratory.

The brain of these free-living flatworms is a biiobed structure with a cortex of nerve cells and a core of nerve fibres including some that decussate to form commissures. Special sensory input from chemoreceptors, photoreceptor cells of primitive eyes, and tactile receptors are integrated to provide motor responses of the entire body, and local reflexes. Many morphological, electrophysiological, and pharmacological features of planarian neurons, as well as synaptic organization, are reminiscent of the vertebrate brain. Multipolar neurons and dendritic spines are rare in higher invertebrates, but are found in the planarian. Several neurotransmitter substances identified in the human brain also occur in the planarian nervous system. The planarian evolved before the divergence of the phylogenetic line leading to vertebrates. This simple worm therefore is suggested as a living example of the early evolution of the vertebrate brain. An extraordinary plasticity and regenerative capacity, and sensitivity to neurotoxins, provide unique opportunities for studying the reorganization of the nervous system after injury. Study of this simple organism may also contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the human nervous system.},

	abstract = {Here we examine the structure of the various types of spine synapses throughout the animal kingdom. Based on available evidence, we suggest that there are two major categories of spine synapses: invaginating and non-invaginating, with distributions that vary among different groups of animals. In the simplest living animals with definitive nerve cells and synapses, the cnidarians and ctenophores, most chemical synapses do not form spine synapses. But some cnidarians have invaginating spine synapses, especially in photoreceptor terminals of motile cnidarians with highly complex visual organs, and also in some mainly sessile cnidarians with rapid prey capture reflexes. This association of invaginating spine synapses with complex sensory inputs is retained in the evolution of higher animals in photoreceptor terminals and some mechanoreceptor synapses. In contrast to invaginating spine synapse, non-invaginating spine synapses have been described only in animals with bilateral symmetry, heads and brains, associated with greater complexity in neural connections. This is apparent already in the simplest bilaterians, the flatworms, which can have well-developed non-invaginating spine synapses in some cases. Non-invaginating spine synapses diversify in higher animal groups. We also discuss the functional advantages of having synapses on spines and more specifically, on invaginating spines. And finally we discuss pathologies associated with spine synapses, concentrating on those systems and diseases where invaginating spine synapses are involved.},

These have generally some content of extremely low density but occasionally a dense core. 2) Dense vesicles (400–1,200 Å in epon embedded tissue) containing highly osmiophilic granules. Between the limiting membrane of the vesicle and the granule there is always a clear rim of variable width. These vesicles closely resemble synaptic vesicles described in vertebrate adrenergic endings. 3) Neurosecretory vesicles (600–1,300 Å in Vestopal embedded tissue) similar to elementary granules observed in neurosecretory systems in vertebrates and invertebrates. All three vesicle types have the same mode of origin from the Golgi membranes. All are present in the nerve cell processes of the neuropil as well as in the perikarya.

The fluorescing components of the peripheral plexus are mostly CA-containing in dorsal regions and 5 HT-containing in ventral regions. Some 5HT cells have processes that penetrate the ventral epidermis. These may be sensory or they may have a cilio-regulatory role.

Neurons in planarian more closely resemble those of vertebrates than those of advanced invertebrates, exhibiting typical vertebrate features of multipolar shape, dendritic spines with synaptic boutons, a single axon, expression of vertebrate-like neural proteins, and relatively low spontaneously generated electrical activity. Here we report the most relevant contribution to the knowledge of the neuropharmacology of planarians, with particular reference to the behavioral consequences of the exposure to drugs acting on neural transmission. Neurochemical and histochemical data indicate the presence of several neurotransmitter-receptor systems in planarians. Moreover, a variety of experimental studies characterized specific behavioral patterns of these animals following the exposure to drugs acting on neural transmission. There is also evidence of the interactions between discrete neurotransmitter-receptor systems in modulating behavior in planarians. Finally, the model has proved efficacy for investigating the neurotoxicology of the dopamine neurons, and for the initial screening of the neuroprotective potential of drugs. In conclusion, these findings indicate that interactions between discrete neurotransmitter-receptor systems occur very early along phylogeny, although they may have evolved from very fundamental behaviors, such as motor activity in planarian, to more complex and integrated functions in vertebrates.},

Certain organisms such as planaria – flatworms that can reproduce through asymmetric fission – avoid the limitations of this barrier, thus blurring the distinction between the processes of inheritance and development. In this paper, we re-evaluate canonical ideas about the interaction between developmental, genetic and evolutionary processes through the lens of planaria. Biased distribution of epigenetic effects in asymmetrically produced parts of a regenerating organism could increase variation and therefore affect the species' evolution. The maintenance and fixing of somatic experiences, encoded via stable biochemical or physiological states, may contribute to evolutionary processes in the absence of classically defined generations. We discuss different mechanisms that could induce asymmetry between the two organisms that eventually develop from the regenerating parts, including one particularly fascinating source – the potential capacity of the brain to produce long-lasting epigenetic changes.},

Here, we aim to advocate for the use of planaria as a valuable model for neurobiology, as well. Planarians have most of the major qualities of more developed organisms, including a primal brain. These traits combined with their exceptional regeneration capabilities, allow neurobiological experiments not possible in any other model organism, as we demonstrate by electrophysiological recording from planaria with two heads that controlling a shared body. To facilitate planarian neuroscience research, we developed an extracellular multi-unit recording procedure for the planarians fragile brain (Dugesia japonica). We created a semi-intact preparation restrained with fine dissection pins, enabling hours of reliable recording, via a suction electrode. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of planarian neurophysiological research by characterizing the neuronal activity during simple learning processes and responses to various stimuli. In addition, we examined the use of linalool as anesthetic agent to allows recordings from an intact, large worm and for fine electrophysiological approaches such as intracellular recording. The demonstrated ability for neurophysiological measurements, along with the inherent advantages of planarians, promotes this exceptional model organism for neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell. A single pyramidal cell has ∼12,000μm dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40\% are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20\% on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5\% of the pyramidal cells’ dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low (∼3\%). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70–100\%) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77–103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated (∼40\%) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high (∼14–17\%), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},
